one

all right testing one two three hello

world can everyone hear me okay

yes yes okay wonderful well so nice to

see so many faces here around the world

if you haven't already feel free to say

hello to everyone else in the chat and

where you're from perhaps uh this is a

live filming of cs50p cs50s new

introduction to programming with python

class as you may know from online in our

emails we're filming these live with you

as the audience so it'll be an

opportunity to ask and to answer

questions along the way um might make

some mistakes along the way so i hope

you'll forgive if we stop or fix things

as we go the final

edited versions of these videos will

then end up on cs50s website youtube edx

and beyond once they're fine-tuned based

on how today goes uh for those who are

joining us for the first time just a

couple of fyis all of today's slides and

all of today's source code the

programming code that i'm going to write

can be found at this url here if you

haven't discovered that already

if you find the chat distracting

something we say each week is that

we

the easiest workaround to do this is to

go to your chat window find the little

triangular menu probably in the top left

and then pop it out and then just drag

and drop it to like the bottom of your

screen and that way you won't constantly

see the badges and the pop-ups but those

who do want to converse via chat or ask

questions of carter my colleague here

can still do so the zoom chat tends to

be a little noisy that does not work on

mobile but it will work on laptops and

desktops if you haven't already this is

the website where you can use vs code or

visual studio code

in the cloud using cs50's account note

that sometimes if too many people log in

all at once github doesn't uh allow us

to have that many people coming through

at once so if you get an error message

wait a minute or more and then give it

another try

and then we have this tradition which is

now if you would like to participate in

a

souvenir photo that will post online go

ahead and turn your camera on if it's

not yet on

go ahead and turn your camera off if you

don't want a photo of what you look like

today to end up on the internet

and we'll go ahead in just a moment and

as some of you are already doing put on

your best smile your best wave and my

colleague rang shin here is going to

take as many screenshots as he can

one at a time in zoom hopefully we'll

catch you at a good looking moment

if not hope you'll forgive there too

feel free to vary it if you want to

change hands or something like that or

put on a funny face maybe we'll catch

that instead but what we're taking is a

whole bunch of screenshots now and then

using fancy software that wrong shin

wrote we'll stitch them all together

into the illusion of one really big

zoom room instead of screen after screen

alright we are all good there uh allow

us to just take a couple of hellos on

camera make sure all of our audio is

working nicely and to hear from some of

you

if function we can put everyone's hand

down

just for a moment

virtually

all right and if you'd like to say hello

to folks on camera here and a little

something about where you are in the

world or about yourself uh why don't we

go ahead and call on just two or three

people before we dive in

let's see how about we start with

all the tiles are moving around chin may

if i'm saying that right

hello yes we can hear you

hello david

it's very nice to learn from you

oh well nice uh nice to have you in the

class welcome where in the world are you

i'm from india nice well welcome to uh

to harvard virtually today uh how about

another hand from the group wrong shin

if we could call on uh harshita next if

i'm saying it right

hello sir it's glad to learn from you i

am parashat sharma from india

i hope i can learn from you yes nice to

meet you as well i'm guessing it's

getting later there so thank you for

staying up with us here how about one

more hello from the group my colleague

ranchin is helping pin people on the

screens here uh say ham if i'm saying it

right

hello hello um

hello i'm seyham i'm palestinian uh but

i'm now in hungary i hope that i learned

from you thank you oh well i do too well

nice to meet you as well so before we

dive into today's two lectures we're

going to film what's called lecture five

which is going to focus on unit tests

then we'll take like a 10 plus minute

break then we'll resume with lecture six

which is going to be focused on file io

input and output if you have no idea

what either of those things are that's

good you're in the right place so after

the first lecture even though you might

hear me saying that's all goodbye we're

just going to take a break and then

start again since we're pretending to

shoot these

separately

before we do that though wanted to

introduce a little informally one topic

that we didn't touch on last week which

was this

for those of you who were in attendance

last week

we ended with this example on the screen

here this was an example of a file

called sayings.pi that had two functions

hello and goodbye

for those who weren't here this was just

an example of two functions that i

started to realize i'm using a lot i

keep writing all these programs that

just say hello all the time and for that

matter that say goodbye now as well and

i realized wouldn't it be nice last week

where our focus was on libraries

wouldn't it be nice to write my hello

function once write my goodbye function

once and then just reuse that code for

project after project after project as

opposed to just copying and pasting or

rewriting these things from scratch so

those of you who are here who are here

might recall that we used that file in a

different code file called say dot pi in

say.pi we imported the sys library which

gives me access to those things called

command line arguments if you weren't

here last week not a problem but this

was the interesting line we were able to

import a specific function from my

sayings.pi file using this line of code

here from sayings import hello and that

just gives me access now in say.pi to

the function called hello in the other

file called sayings.pi and it allows me

to really invent my own library that i

can now use in this program and any

future programs as well and heck if i

put it on the internet you also could

use my hello or my goodbye function but

it's worth knowing that

you can create problems for yourself

when creating libraries if you don't

adhere to best practices and so let me

propose this let me first run this

program to remind you what it did if i

run python of say.pi and then my name

david it just said hello david and

that's the code we're looking at right

here but notice that the function we're

calling on line six hello is actually

defined in this other file

sayings.pi now suppose that i realized

that um

i might want my sayings file to be

functional onto it unto itself and i

just want to be able to test this file

and so up until now we've been in the

habit of running our own functions by

defining arbitrarily but conventionally

a function called main and so suppose i

just want to try out this function i

might do this hello quote unquote world

and then let me try out the other one

goodbye quote unquote world as well in

other words i'm defining a main function

for the sole purpose of like testing

these two functions now of course if i

go back to my terminal and run python of

sayings.pi enter nothing happens

and just to rewind to past weeks why did

nothing happen how can i fix this at the

moment

i have a main function now and i have

hello and goodbye why did nothing happen

on the screen any volunteers

yeah over to girkon if i'm saying it

right

can you hear me yes we can what are your

thoughts

okay uh we didn't call main function at

the end of the file exactly we didn't

call main so this is not like c or c

plus plus where main just happens

automatically for you in python you have

to be more deliberate and actually call

the function so up until now the habit

we've been in is just calling main as

the very last line of your file just to

guarantee that main is absolutely called

but it's the last thing that's called so

that you're defining defining defining

first so that the functions all exist

and then at the very end you kick off

the execution of the program by actually

calling main so this is now correct for

sayings.pi and if i run python of

sayings.pi again notice that we see my

two test outputs hello world and goodbye

world so all is working well but notice

this i've created a side effect for

myself if i leave those tests in that

file that is i leave my main function in

there

notice what happens if i go over to

say.pi now which is a completely

different function program that is

importing one function i'm not importing

main i'm not importing goodbye i'm only

using hello just like before so let me

do just like before this python of

say.pi and then david my name in the

command line argument i should see like

before hello comma david

but let me hit enter

i'm saying hello world goodbye world and

then hello david and this is a really

bad feature of a library if i'm just

trying to use this function hello and

it's presuming to output hello world

goodbye world and then what i actually

care about so let me ask the group again

why now is this happening just to be

clear why am i seeing three lines of

output from say.pi even though

i only called hello once dev your

thoughts

yeah i think it's because you call

domain within sayings.pi yeah it's of

course because i called main in

sayings.pi and it turns out when you

import a function or anything else from

a file the entire file is interpreted by

python top to bottom left to right so if

you've got a line like my last one in

saying stop i main open paren close

paren it's going to call main no matter

what even if you didn't run

sayings.pi at the command line itself so

i could of course just undo everything i

did i could go back to sayings.pi and i

could just delete this last line i could

even delete main but then i've lost my

test functions and maybe longer term

it's just convenient to be able to test

my hello and goodbye function so that

too doesn't feel like an ideal solution

so the right way of doing this the

typical way of doing this is to actually

introduce a fairly funny symbol here so

it turns out that built into python is

this special variable underscore

underscore name underscore underscore

and that variable is automatically set

by python whenever you run a program

specifically it's set to a specific

value if you have run a program directly

so what do i mean by this let me go

ahead and change sayings.pi to not just

blindly call main anymore let me do this

albeit cryptically if underscore

underscore name underscore underscore

and there's indeed two underscores even

though the font is making them look

close together

if that variable equals equals quote

unquote underscore underscore main

underscore underscore quote and now let

me add my colon and indent main as part

of this conditional this is now saying

to python only call the main function

if the name of this file is itself main

and honestly this is not at all clear

when just looking at the code how this

works but let me show you by

demonstration let me go back to my

terminal window and run python of

sayings.pi

which in the past printed hello world

goodbye world and that's it because

that's all that's in this file but

notice i'm conditionally calling main at

the bottom of this file but let's see if

the condition works out to be true let

me hit enter in my terminal

and it works hello world goodbye world

now works but now let me change tabs let

me go back to say.pi and notice that

i've made no changes to this i'm still

importing

from sayings the hello function which is

still going to involve python reading

the entirety of sayings.pi top to bottom

left to right and doing what it says but

because sayings.pi

now has this conditional saying only

execute main if the name of the file is

main this import is going to behave

differently when i now go back to my

terminal and run not python of

sayings.pi but python of say.pi this

shorter program here

it is now using hello by importing it

not by running the sayings.pi file

directly i'm running say.pi instead so

when i hit enter now you'll see that

damn it so now nothing happened let me

fix that that's user error not

not curricular error now python of

say.pi in my name like before and let me

hit enter and now we only see hello

david so in short the right way moving

forward to define a main function is

just as we've done up here if you want

to have a main function that's fine do

it but only call it conditionally

because you want to make sure that main

is only called when you run the file

directly python of sayings.pi you don't

want main to be called when you import

this file or any functions they're from

so that's what this very cryptic looking

condition is doing and it's indeed

deliberate that it's underscore

underscore main underscore underscore

this is just automatically done for you

by python

independent of your having defined the

main function all right that's a lot let

me pause and see if there's any

questions

any questions here yeah how about over

to

uh nathan

from you

is there any reason why there are two

underscores in front and before

is that is there a specific reason why

they're there or is that just a way of

defining them it's a convention so it's

that way just because that's what the

authors of python decided in many

languages though it is conventional for

the authors of the language to reserve

sort of unofficially any variable that

starts with underscore underscore is

belonging to the language itself like

you the programmer should not write

functions that start with underscore

underscore single underscore is okay

double underscore is bad um it's a

little weird that there's underscores at

the end of it too but that's just what

the python community has done it's a

visual clue that this isn't your special

thing it's someone else's design

a good question other questions on this

use of name and main uh anish if i'm

saying it right

hi david uh david i have one query like

if you run

sainsbury then it will output us

uh hello world goodbye world right

correct so does that mean that by

default if we run a particular file even

though we have set that underscore name

to be understands for main python

assumes that the file name is still

underscoring main and its current story

when you run it directly this all

happens automatically for you but when

you import it underscore underscore name

is not set to main

it's not and for demonstration sake let

me try this let me do this instead of

doing all of this let me go into

sayings.pi and do print underscore

underscore name underscore underscore

and now let me do this let me run python

of sayings.pi enter and you'll see that

the name of this file by convention even

though we've named it something else is

underscore underscore main if i now do

this python of say dot pi which imports

from this file we see

this we see that the name of the file is

not underscore underscore main because

it hasn't been run from the command line

directly it's instead the name of the

file itself and this is useful to be

clear because recall the libraries we

did talk about last week if you were

here we looked at the uh random library

the statistics library and there's so

many others as well

khao say library it would be really bad

really obnoxious if any of those

libraries had their own main function

and just because you import one of those

libraries boom you're seeing someone

else's output so this is a solution to

that problem to avoid other people's

libraries or your own libraries from

having these side effects how about one

more question before we reset and dive

into today's unit tests uh josh v if i'm

saying it right

uh

it was just a curious question david uh

what if we run uh instead of your name

we write main in say dot pi would it

implement hello world and goodbye world

or would you print hello main and

goodbye me

um hello me so instead of let me go back

to the file

so instead of world plugging in

something else here

oh sorry there we go

dot i okay

when you entered your name uh what if we

entered there instead of david main

if we said instead of david mayne

instead

yes

oh i mean we i'm if i'm hearing you

correctly are you proposing that i do

this

uh yeah okay we can do that let me do

that so python of say dot pi and you'll

uh let me fix the other file let me undo

my change to sayings.pi so i have the if

condition that we've been promoting here

let me now rerun this correctly

enter

oops here we go

i still have to provide a command line

argument so that the length of argv is

two and you now see hello main so yes

you can see that as well

it's a coincidence though that we're

talking about names like my human name

but the name of this variable is also

underscore underscore name it's cryptic

this is not the best clearest design but

this is the way it is so moving forward

anytime you write a main function and

call a main function don't call it

blindly like we have been previously

because that's going to create new

problems for us always wrap it in this

conditional using literally this syntax

you don't change name and you don't

change underscore underscore main those

are just always that way just because so

to speak all right give me just a moment

to close these files and in just a

minute or so we'll resume with today's

lecture five on unit tests

all right this is cs50s introduction to

programming with python my name is david

malin and this is our week on unit tests

up until now we've been writing a lot of

code and you might have been testing

your code by running your program and

passing in some sample inputs and

running it again and passing in some

sample inputs or you might have been

waiting for us to test your code instead

but it's actually much better practice

to get into the habits sooner rather

than later of testing your own code

using code of your own in fact whether

you're writing a personal project or

working in industry it's very common

nowadays to not only write code to solve

the problems that you want to solve but

also to write a little extra code to

test the code that you wrote and that's

what we're going to focus on today

writing our own tests so as to be all

the more confident all the more certain

that the problems we have been trying to

solve are in fact solved correctly so

let's rewind a few weeks now to a

program we wrote a while back namely to

to calculate uh numbers and specifically

we left off with this calculator on

trying to compute the power of a number

like x squared or

where x might be 2 or 3 or some other

number as well well let me go ahead and

resurrect that file by going into my

terminal window here and running again

code of calculator dot pi and let me go

ahead and pick up where we left off way

back when by defining a main function

here and then in my main function i did

something like this i said x equals int

of input and i asked the user what's x

question mark and then i immediately

went ahead and printed out something

like x squared is and then i passed in

as a second argument to print the result

of calling a function called square

passing in that value x now of course i

haven't yet implemented the square

function so let's define that as well

let me go down a couple of lines and

define square

and it takes an argument recall a

parameter that at the time i called n

for number so i'll do that again so i

could technically choose any name for

this variable and i recall did this i

returned n times n and there were

multiple ways to do this the squaring a

number is multiplying it by itself so i

could also use other syntax here but

this is what we ultimately settled on

and then recall that i ultimately called

main in order to kick off the process of

running this program so just as a test

manually let me go ahead and run python

of calculator.pi and hit enter what's x

let's start with 2. all right x squared

is 4 i think that's correct so let's run

it again just for good measure python of

calculator.pi let's type in 3 for x this

time

x squared is 9. and i think that's

correct and i might be feeling pretty

good at this point and i go off and

submit my code to a course or i post it

on the internet for others to use but i

haven't really methodically tested this

code and it's not necessarily the case

that it works entirely in fact i haven't

really considered a number of corner

cases i went with some pretty obvious

numbers like two and three but what

about 0 what about negative numbers what

about any number of other infinite

numbers well we're not going to test an

infinite number of inputs to this

because the program would never halt but

we should test some representative

inputs ultimately but before we do that

let's get into the habit of making sure

that maine isn't always called let's

adopt this habit again of doing if

underscore underscore name underscore

underscore equals equals quote unquote

underscore underscore main underscore

underscore only then should we execute

main and i'm doing this now proactively

because i want to make sure that when i

import my square function perhaps from

another library from another file

treating it as though it's a library i

want to make sure that main is not just

automatically called itself now what do

i want to do from here now that i've

modified this program as follows well

let's go ahead and write a completely

different program whose sole purpose in

life is to now test this program so i've

got my actual calculator in

calculator.pi i've readied myself to

call main conditionally so that i can

safely import one or more things from

this file in another file well what

should that other file be well by

convention i'm going to create a file

that's called test underscore

and then because the thing i'm testing

is this calculator itself let's call

this file testcalculator.pi

that's going to give me a new tab in

which i can write a brand new program

whose purpose in life is now

specifically to test that program but

really that program specific

functionality built into that program is

the square function let's focus on

testing that function alright so how do

i access that function in this program

well recall that i can import a function

from another file as though it's a

library of my own a so-called module so

i'm going to do this from calculator

import square

i could go ahead and just import square

itself but then i would have to prefix

my use of square recall by saying

calculator dot everywhere and it's just

a little cleaner to just import the one

function and now let me go ahead and do

this let me go ahead and define a

function called test square this two is

a convention if you want to test a

function called square your function for

testing should be called test underscore

square or alternatively you could do

square underscore test but i'll adopt

this convention here now what kind of

tests can we do well i don't dislike the

tests i ran earlier testing x equals 2

and x equals 3 but every time i

want to test my program previously i

would have to do that manually and

that's going to get tedious it's not

going to be easy for someone else to

test it and if i'm actually working in

the real world it would be nice if i

could automatically have my program

tested again and again by having some

automated process run my own code so

let's do that and take the human

ultimately out of the equation so how

might i go about testing the square

function that i've now imported per line

one well in my test square function why

do i do this if

the result of calling square of 2 does

not equal 4 why don't we go ahead and

print an error message because i know

that in the real world 2 squared should

equal 4 so if square of 2 does not equal

4 there's a bug in my program there's a

bug in my function i've made a mistake

so let me go ahead and print something

like that so i or someone else knows 2

squared was not 4 for instance so i

could print out anything here what

should i maybe next test well let's do

more than one test let's say if the

square of 3 does not equal 3 squared 9

then let's go ahead and print out that 3

squared was not 9. so i haven't done any

more testing than i did earlier but i've

baked those two tests x equals 2 and x

equals 3 into my own code here so i can

now run those tests automatically if you

will now it's not enough to just define

a function called test square

i actually if i want to run this

function need to call it somehow and our

convention for doing that is the same as

always in this function here in this

file too let me define main and main's

sole purpose in life is going to be to

test square and now at the bottom of

this file as before let me go ahead and

adopt my convention of if underscore

underscore name underscore underscore

equals equals quote unquote underscore

underscore main underscore underscore

then go ahead and call main so a lot of

this is just boilerplate like we've seen

this before defining a main function and

calling a function to kick off some

process now adding the conditional at

the bottom of the file to make sure i'm

only conditionally calling main just in

case i import anything from this file

elsewhere so let's see let's go ahead

and test my code now let me go ahead and

run

test calculator with python and hit

enter

and nothing outputs

nothing outputs but i think it's okay i

think no output is good because look at

my test square function i'm not printing

anything

if all seems well so let's let's

demonstrate as much by going back to my

calculator and let me break it let me

introduce a bug maybe i didn't even get

it right the first time maybe my code

originally looked like this i wasn't

thinking i forgot my squares and so i

thought that the square of a number is n

plus n instead of n times n so a

reasonable mistake to make perhaps

arithmetically let me now go back to my

test calculator which i'm not going to

change but i am going to rerun it python

of testcalculator.pi

i'm going to cross my fingers here but

for naught i'm going to see immediately

that 3 squared was not 9.

now what is it well let's see when your

tests fail how can we put our finger on

what's wrong well it's a little

interesting that i completely broke my

square function and yet only one of

these tests is failing it looks like

this test lines 9 and 10 is fine because

i'm not seeing that output but of course

these

two lines this test is failing because 3

squared is not 9 when i'm using plus so

just to be clear here why

is my function only partially broken

just to be clear why am i seeing only

one error instead of two even though the

square function is now mathematically

broken uh nikita

because two plus two is four

yeah i mean it's as simple as that i

just got lucky that two plus two is the

same thing as two times two so this is

one of those corner cases and this is

why it's good to be in the habit of not

just testing one thing but test several

and make sure you're covering your bases

so to speak so i got lucky here and that

explains why i'm seeing only one error

even though the function itself is

flawed but let me propose that there's

another way we could do this because

honestly if i extrapolate from this

simple example running not just two

tests but three or four or 10 or 20

tests you can imagine that my god the

code is going to get so much more

complicated than the function itself i

mean already look in calculator.pi the

function in question is two lines long

and yet in test calculator the code in

question is five lines long like i've

written more code to test my code than i

actually wrote original code so the

fewer lines of code we can write when

testing code i think the more likely you

and i are to do it because it's going to

be literally a little less work and just

fewer opportunities for mistakes so

what's another approach i can take here

well it turns out in python there is

another keyword that we haven't yet used

which is this here assert a cert is a

keyword in python and some other

languages as well that allow you to do

exactly that as in english to assert

that something is true to sort of boldly

claim that something is true and if it

is

nothing's going to happen no errors are

going to appear on the screen but if you

assert something in python and it is not

true that is the thing you're in

asserting a boolean expression is false

you're actually going to see some kind

of error on the screen

so let's go ahead and try this new

keyword as follows let me go back to my

code here and just to make it a little

simpler

let me propose that i

use this new keyword as follows let me

simply assert that the square of two

should equal four so i've changed my

logic instead of checking for not equals

i'm now asserting very loudly that it

should equal four and then on one

additional line let me do the other test

assert that the square of three equals

equals nine and that's it no if no

indented print i'm just going to assert

more simply these two things that i want

to be true well let me go ahead now with

calculator.pi still broken i'm still

using plus accidentally instead of

multiplication let me go ahead now and

run python of testcalculator.pi crossing

my fingers as always but it's not going

to go well this time a whole lot of

errors seem to appear on the screen and

if i scroll up here for this traceback

we'll see that the thing that failed was

this line here a cert square of 3 equals

equals 9. now unfortunately when you're

using the assert keyword it's not

terribly user-friendly it shows you the

files and the line numbers involved but

it does show you the specific line of

code that failed the assertion that

failed so to speak it's now kind of up

to you and me to infer from this well

wait a minute why is the square of 3 not

equal to 9. so it's not super

user-friendly but honestly it was like

half as much code for me to write it's

just two lines instead of those previous

four but notice this little remnant down

here this was an assertion error and we

have seen errors before we've seen

errors before when we've made other

mistakes in our code and in the past

what was our solution

for catching those errors

how do we catch errors that seem to

resemble this even though we've not seen

this one before tolu

yeah in python we can use the try and

accept keywords to try to do something

optimistically except if something goes

wrong do something else instead so this

is a step forward and that i can at

least catch this error but it's going to

be perhaps a step backward and that i'm

going to end up writing i'll admit in

advance a little more code

instead so let me go ahead and try this

let me go back into my code here and

instead of just asserting blindly let me

go ahead as totally proposed and try

to do this first assertion except if

there is an assertion error like we saw

a moment ago then go ahead and print out

something more user friendly that

explains what actually failed 2 squared

is was not 4

and let me go ahead similarly and try to

assert that the square of 3 equals 9

except if there's an assertion error

there in which case i'm going to print

out more user friendly 3 squared was not

9. so i've taken a step forward but also

a step back because now i have more code

but i have at least introduced

assertions and exceptions in a manner

consistent with how we've seen in the

past when something goes wrong you

actually see an exception raised well

let me go ahead and run this version of

the program now instead python of

testcalculator.pi crossing my fingers

all right it still failed because i'm

seeing output but we're back to at least

user-friendly output so that's at least

progress in some way here but it's again

more code than might have been ideal and

in fact if we continue this further what

if we actually want to add additional

test cases here as well

well it seems like we might end up

writing way more code than would be

ideal for instance i'm testing two and

three now i should probably test some

negative numbers as well so why don't i

go ahead and add in for instance let me

go ahead and copy and paste this let me

try to assert that the square of

negative 2 equals equals 4 which should

be the case mathematically and if not

let me go ahead and change this to say

negative 2 squared was not 4 and you

know what let me go ahead and copy paste

this again test another negative number

just for good measure let's test the

square of negative 3 which should equal

9 but if it doesn't let's go ahead and

say that negative 3 squared was not 9.

and just to think aloud here what might

be another good value to test i've tried

2 i've tried 3. i've tried negative 2

i've tried negative 3. i can't try in

infinite numbers but there's at least

something that's a little different in

between those values let's try 0. 0 is

an interesting case too just in case

something might be wrong and y zero i'm

just going with instincts here right

odds are positive numbers are generally

going to behave the same negative

numbers might generally behave the same

zero might be a little anomalous there's

no

science to it necessarily but rather

considering for yourself based on your

own experience like what are the

potential corner cases based on the

function you're trying to test i'm

trying to test something mathematical so

i want to test representative values so

let me go ahead and paste in one more

try except block let's assert that the

square of zero should equal zero and if

not i'll say something explanatory like

zero squared was not zero now if i go

ahead and run this python of

testcalculator.pi and hit enter

now i see multiple errors and this is

interesting it's a bit of a clue because

notice that some but not all of these

assertions are failing

the one for 2 squared is apparently ok

as we noted earlier recall that two

squared happens to be two plus two so

that bug doesn't really throw off our

test but it's a good thing we tested for

three it's a good thing we tested for

negative two and negative three because

all of those tests caught this error the

zero test did not notice because zero

squared is of course zero but zero plus

zero is zero so we're getting lucky or

unlucky there depending on how you you

view the glass is half full or half

empty here we at least by way of having

multiple tests caught this mistake

somehow so it would be nice though if we

weren't

writing so much darn code here right

because notice what i've done i have try

accept try except i have all of these

assertions i have a main function i have

this if conditional at the bottom of my

file i mean honestly who's going to want

to write 31 lines of code now just to

test a two-line function right no one's

going to write test code like this if

we're all

writing so much more code to do the

actual testing

so people have solved this problem if

you are in the habit of testing your

code a lot or wanting to if i'm in the

habit of wanting to test my code a lot

if everyone else in the real world is in

this habit of wanting to test their code

why don't we create tools that make it a

little easier to do so and in fact there

is a mechanism for doing this whereby we

can use a tool that's popularly called

pi test so pi test is a third-party

program that you can download and

install that will automate the testing

of your code so long as you write the

tests but what's nice about this library

and others like it is that it adopts

some conventions so that you don't have

to write as many lines of code yourself

manually they do some of that

automatically for you now this is a

third-party library there's other

libraries for unit tests so to speak

that is testing units of your code some

of them come with python itself we're

proposing that we look at pi test today

because it's actually a little simpler

than the unit testing frameworks that

come with python itself and what do we

mean by unit testing unit testing is

just a formal way of describing testing

individual units of your program what

are those individual units they're

typically functions so unit tests are

typically tests for functions that you

have written now what does this mean in

practice here well let me go back to my

vs code here and let me propose that we

simplify

my test calculator significantly i'm

going to go ahead and delete all of

these tests which were

which we're accumulating to like 31

lines of code and let's see if we can

distill the tests to their essence using

pi test from my same calculator program

let me still import square so i do still

need that line of code so that i can

test that specific function now i'm

going to go ahead and define a function

just like i did before as follows i'm

going to define a function called test

square again by convention test

underscore and the name of the function

you want to test though it doesn't have

to be that way and now i'm going to go

ahead and make a few assertions i'm

going to assert that the square of 2

should equal 4. i'm going to assert that

the square of 3 should equal 9. i'm

going to assert that the square of

negative 2 should equal 4 and i'm going

to insert that the square of negative 3

should equal 9 and lastly for now i'm

going to assert that the square of 0

should equal 0. so i'm still using the

assert keyword as i introduced earlier

and even though it was a little tedious

to type those i mean it's only eight

lines of code now and they're so easy to

type it's not trying except in all of

this

wouldn't it be nice if something else

someone else handled the try the accept

the printing all of the standardization

of actually running these tests and

that's where indeed pi test comes into

play per the documentation for pi test

which can itself be installed with pip

install pi test which we've used to

install other libraries in the past you

can look at the documentation here for

all of its formal usage but fortunately

pi test is pretty user friendly as

testing frameworks go and it actually

allows us to dive right in by just

running pi test on the code that we've

written so if i go back to vs code here

and look at my testcalculator.pi

which notice has no main function

anymore it has no conditional it has no

tries it has no accepts it has no prints

it just has my few assertions pi test

and other libraries like it are going to

automate the process of running these

tests for me and

informing me on the screen whether or

not any of those tests failed so let me

go ahead and do this i'm going to go

ahead and increase the size of my

terminal window for a moment just so we

can see more on the screen and i'm going

to run not python as i've been doing i'm

going to run pi test which again is this

third party tool for running tests in

your code i'm going to run pi test of

test underscore calculator so that same

file i'm going to cross my fingers as

always and hit enter and we'll see that

ah

something has failed now admittedly even

though i do think you'll find that pi

test is relatively simple to use its

output at least at first glance is not

necessarily super user friendly so what

are we seeing here we'll notice at the

very top of my window is the command

that i ran after my prompt right below

that is a single f in red which means

fail so not very encouraging i tried

really hard here but fail is my grade on

this program but let's see exactly what

happened well if i look at this excerpt

here under failures you'll see that test

square is the function that failed all

right that makes sense because that's

the only one i wrote and you'll see here

somewhat

arcane output describing what the error

was so what you're seeing here is the

first line of output equals equals 4

which is fine there's no red error

message below that so that one's okay

but this line of code here assert that

square of 3 equals equals 9 pi test did

not like that assertion because it

didn't end up being true in fact per the

red e at the start of this line you'll

see that i'm effectively trying to

assert that six equals equals nine now

where did the six come from okay wait a

minute if my test involves this notice

that where 6 equals square of 3 this is

saying that because i've called square

passing in a value of 3 it turns out its

return value is 6 and of course

mathematically 6 does not equal equal 9

so that's why this is failing now pi

test is not as user friendly as telling

you exactly why the bug is there or how

to fix it this is really just a clue to

you what must be wrong what you're

seeing here is a clue that the first

test passed because there's no red error

below that line of code but this test

failed somehow or other your square

function is returning 6 when passed in 3

instead of nine so at this point you

sort of put your detective hat on you go

back to your actual code and you think

about in calculator to pi how in the

world is line seven of my square

function returning six instead of nine

and at this point odds are the light

bulb would go off above your head

proverbially and you would see oh i'm

using addition instead of multiplication

but what pi test has done for us is

automate the process of at least

pointing out that error for us and if i

now go in and fix this let me go ahead

and the light bulb has gone off i change

the plus to a

to multiply now i'm going to go ahead

and after clearing my screen i'm going

to run not python but pi test of

testcalculator.pi

crossing my fingers again and now it's

green and i see just a dot which

indicates that my one and only test

passed

i'm good a hundred percent success with

my test now after fixing that bug all

right let me pause here and see

if there's any questions

about pi test about my file or what i'm

seeing here bashal

um hi thanks for

letting me ask the question so my

question is what if a user

instead of because we are taking input

from the user what if the user is

somewhat malicious and types in a string

instead of an integer or maybe he types

in a float or some other data type

really good question

yeah so what if the user like we've seen

in past examples types in cat instead of

a number when we're expecting an integer

how do we test for something like that

at the moment i'm admittedly not testing

user input if i go back to my code here

notice that my calculator function of

course has the square function that we

keep testing and re-testing but notice

that all of the user input is currently

relegated to my main function and

admittedly as of now i am not testing my

main function so there could be one of

those bugs and in fact there would be

because if the user types in a string

like cat instead of an integer like two

or three then line two recall would

actually raise a value error exception

so we've seen that before so when it

comes to testing your code this is

actually a good reason for having

multiple functions in your program

rather than putting all of your logic in

just the file itself rather than putting

all of the logic in just main it's

actually really good really helpful

practice to break your ideas up into

smaller bite-sized functions that

themselves are testable and what do i

mean here square is perfectly testable

why because it takes as input a

parameter called n

and it returns as output in integer

which is going to be the square thereof

hopefully it has a well-defined input

and a well-defined output it is

therefore completely within your control

in your test program to pass in those

values now i will say if you want to

test whether

square behaves properly when past

something like a string like quote

unquote cat we could absolutely do

something like this assert that the

square of

quote unquote cat it's not going to

equal something you can actually using

different syntax assert that a specific

exception will be raised so if we were

actually going to go back into our

square function improve it and

deliberately raise an exception we could

test for that too but for now i'm

deliberately only testing the square

function i'm not testing

for specific user input but that's

another problem to be solved other

questions now

on unit tests yeah

hope do you use the units test to test a

code for

the

cs50 check

check 50. so check 50 is similar in

spirit check 50 is a tool that we cs50

wrote that is essentially doing

something like pi test for the

evaluation of students code it is

similar in spirit but think of check 50

as being an alternative to pi test if

you will but it works a little bit

differently but same idea pi test and

unit testing more generally is a

technique that is independent of cs50

and is something that you can and should

be doing on your own code both in or

outside of this class how about one

other question here on

on um on our uh unit tests uh lavanya

i'm adviser hello

my question is instead of writing 4

times like s square of 2 is equal to 4

instead of that can we write if is it

i is equals to in square brackets the

numbers we want

instead of writing 4 lines a really good

question absolutely right now if i go

back to testcalculator.pi

it's indeed pretty manual i mean it took

me a while to say and to type out those

several lines and you could imagine

writing some kind of loop to just

assert in a loop that this equals that

that this equals that and so forth using

a list or using maybe a list or a

dictionary or some structure like that

so yes you can absolutely automate some

of these tests by not just doing the

same thing again and again you can still

use all of the syntax of python to do

loops but generally speaking your tests

should be pretty simple and in fact let

me propose that we improve upon even

this design further because at the

moment what's not really ideal

when i run all of this

when i run all of these tests when my

function is buggy is notice the output

that i got let me reintroduce that same

bug by changing my multiplication back

to addition let me increase the size of

my terminal window again and let me run

pi test again of testcalculator.pi so

this is the version of my code now that

has the bug again so i'm going to see

that big massive failure where this

failure has been displayed to me but

this is not as helpful as it could be

right because i have all of those other

tests in my code recall that i had what

one two three four five separate tests

and i'm only seeing the output of the

first now why is that well if we go back

to my code here you'll see that the

first assertion that's failing namely

this one here that assert of square of

three equals equals nine the other tests

aren't even getting run and that's not a

big deal in the sense that my code is

buggy so one or more of them are

probably going to fail anyway but

wouldn't it be nice to know which of

them are going to fail and in fact it's

ideal to run as many tests all at once

as possible to give you as many clues as

possible to finding your bug so let me

propose that we improve the design of my

testing code now still using pi test as

follows instead of having one big

function called test square that tests

the entire function itself with so many

different inputs let's break down my

tests into different categories and here

too there's no one right way to do this

but my mind is thinking that i should

maybe test positive numbers separately

test negative numbers separately and

test zero separately i could think of

other ways i could test even numbers i

could test odd numbers or maybe some

other pattern altogether but separating

this big test into multiple tests is

probably going to yield more clues for

me when something goes wrong so let me

do this

let me go ahead and rename this function

to test positive initially and let me

include in that function only those

first two tests let me then create

another function here called test

negative and in this function let me

test only negative 2 and negative 3.

then down here let me do one more def of

test 0 and i'll just run one test in

there so i have the same assertions the

same five but i've now divided them up

among three separate functions what's

nice about pi test and other unit

testing frameworks is that all three of

these test functions will be run

automatically even if one of them fails

the others will be attempted that means

that if one or two or three of them fail

i'll have one or two or three clues now

for helping me find that mistake so let

me go ahead and again increase the size

of my terminal window just so we can see

more on the screen my calculator still

has the bug using addition instead of

multiplication let me go ahead and run

not python but again pi test of

testcalculator.pi

crossing my fingers is always and now oh

my god there's even more errors on the

screen but this in itself is more

helpful let's work through them from top

to bottom so under failures here in all

caps which i know is not very

encouraging to see failure when you're

just trying to solve a problem but

that's what these frameworks do under

failures the first function that failed

is test positive but here too we see the

same clue as before the first one 2 the

square of 2 equals equals 4. that one's

fine it's not airing with any red errors

but the next one is failing so i know

that square is broken when i pass in 3.

all right what about down here it looks

like unfortunately my test negative

function is failing 2y well when i pass

in oh this is interesting here now

negative 2 doesn't even work so i got

lucky with positive 2 but negative 2

isn't working so that's a bit of a clue

but in total only two tests failed so

notice at the very bottom this summary

two failed and one passed what's the

other one what was the third one test

zero so test zero is passing these two

are failing and so that kind of leads me

logically mathematically if you will to

the source of the bug and just to be

clear too if you have a lot of tests

this little one line output is helpful

even though also a bit discouraging fail

fail and dot means pass so there are the

three tests just depicted graphically a

little bit differently well let me

rewind now and go back into

calculator.pi let's fix that bug because

let's suppose that i've deduced okay i'm

using addition i should have been using

multiplication all this time let me now

after fixing the bug yet again let me go

back to my big terminal let me run pi

test of test calculator up high hitting

enter crossing my fingers now and dot

dot dot means all is well 100 of my

tests passed all three of them

so now i'm good it doesn't necessarily

mean that my code is 100 correct but it

does mean that it has passed 100 of my

current tests and so it would probably

behoove us to think a little harder

about maybe we should test bigger

numbers maybe we should test even

smaller numbers maybe we should test

strings or something else the onus is

ultimately on you to decide what you're

going to test but in the real world

you're going to be very unhappy with

yourself or someone else maybe your boss

is going to be very unhappy with you if

you did not catch a bug in your code

which you could have caught had you just

written a test to try that kind of input

all right let me pause again and see if

there's any questions now

on unit testings with pi test

yeah uh anjali over to you

hi it's anjali anjali yes um

yeah

um so if you wanted to test like someone

suggested before user input as well as

testing your function do you do that

within the same file or do you make

separate files for different types of

tests really good question you could

absolutely make separate files to test

different types of things or if you

don't have that many you can keep them

all in the same file at the moment i've

been storing all of my tests in one file

for convenience and there's not terribly

many of them but we'll take a look in a

bit in an example that allows me to put

them into a folder and even run pi test

on a whole folder of tests as well so

that's possible other questions on unit

testing

uh yeah peuge

can you hear me yes we can

hi uh so i've got two questions um

so uh a couple while ago you just used

um an exception called assassin

um i'm not sure what was yeah assertion

error

what exactly does that particular error

catch

and my second question is

does the assert keyword

um

stand out to the compiler and exactly

tell them to insert this particular

line of code indeed the assert keyword

we're seeing and the assertion error we

saw earlier are intertwined so when you

use assert and the assertion fails

because whatever boolean expression

you're using is not true it's false an

assertion error by definition of python

will be raised so those two work in

conjunction

those errors those assertion errors are

still being raised by my code here when

any of these lines of code fail however

pi test this third party library is

handling the process of catching those

exceptions automatically for me so as to

give me the standard output so we

started today's story by really

implementing unit testing myself i wrote

all of the code myself i wrote main i

did my conditional i did try and accept

honestly it's going to get incredibly

painful to write tests long term if you

and i have to write that much code every

time especially when our function is

this small

so pi test and unit testing frameworks

like it just automates so much of that

essentially pi test adds the try the

accept the if the prints for you so you

can just focus on the essence of the

tests which really are these inputs and

outputs how about time for one other

question here on unit testing as well

yeah over to uh jayish if i'm saying it

right

yes sir uh

sorry

am i audible sir yes we can hear you

okay sir uh when we uh enter

minus six or minus five uh the

uh square or square uh square root of

that

number comes up but when we put a 6.6 or

5.6 something like that integer then uh

line shows the error so

what's happening there

what's happening there if you pass in a

float instead of

yes so

if i'm deliberately testing integers

right now in large part because i only

want pow to operate on integers and that

might be conveyed in python's

documentation or my own documentation

for that function if you were to pass in

something else like a float it turns out

that floating point values in python and

other languages are actually very hard

if not impossible to represent 100

percent precisely and so if you are

trying to compare it against some other

value they might be slight rounding

errors as a result i'm just inferring

from what you've described but i'm very

deliberately now testing this function

with only the inputs that i would expect

it might indeed throw other errors if

other inputs are passed all right allow

me to propose in fact that we consider

not just testing code that deals with

integers as inputs and outputs which as

all things go is relatively

straightforward what if we're dealing

with strings as well and let me rewind

us in time here in vs code to that very

first program we wrote a few different

versions of in hello.pi that ultimately

looked a little something like this i

had a main function that prompted the

user for the value of a variable by

asking them what's your name question

mark and then we went ahead and did

something like hello open paren name

passing that user's name into a function

called hello now that function hello

recall ultimately looked like this we

defined hello as taking a parameter

called two the default value of which

was world and that function very simply

printed hello

followed by a comma and then whatever

the name that had been passed in and

then we ultimately called main but for

now onward i'm going to always add this

if conditional if name equals equals

underscore underscore main then and only

then do i want to call main so that's

essentially what this program looked

like in its last incarnation how do we

go about testing it well here again too

i'm not going to test the user's input

per se in main i'm going to focus really

on the module the module of code here

that's of interest which is the hello

function itself how can i go about

testing

the hello function

well unfortunately even if i start by

doing something like code of test hello

dot pi let me go about and start writing

a test program i could import from my

hello program a function called hello so

a bit strange to see from hello import

hello but notice that on this line here

i'm importing from the module that is

the file called hello.pi the function

called hello and how do i go about

testing this well

if i have a function like define

test argument

like this well let me sue this

so if i were to find a function like

define

test hello what could i do well i could

call hello with quote unquote say

david

and then check if it equals what hello

comma david

so would this work this approach here if

i've written a test

called test hello that calls hello with

an argument of david and then tests its

return value just like we've done for

our calculator with this work as written

and let me go back to in just a moment

the version of hello that we're testing

so you can see that function hello

here's the test

here's the actual code

would this test now work

any thoughts

yeah a valentino

okay

yeah can you hear me yes we can

okay uh i think the problem is that in

the first version in hello dot pi

you're using the toe argument that you

first declare when you declare the

function instead of using the name

okay i that is actually

uh not a bug here so let me stipulate

that in hello.pi this code actually does

work as intended and let me go ahead and

test it manually just to demonstrate as

much let me run python of hello.pi

typing in as my name david and i see in

fact that it says hello david if though

i were to change this program and get

rid of the name argument get rid of the

name variable and just call hello again

running python if hello.pi this time i'm

not even prompted because i got rid of

my input call but it does pre-behave as

i expect it does say hello world so let

me stipulate that this code in its

current form is actually correct but my

test is not going to work as i'd hoped

and there's a subtle difference between

hello versus my pal function that expl

versus my there's a subtle difference

between my hello function and my square

function that explains

why might this test not work as intended

michael

uh because it's not returning a value

yeah exactly recall our discussion early

on about functions functions can either

return a value like my square function

hands you back the square of some value

or they can have side effects sort of

visual

artifacts that might happen on the

screen like printing something out on

the screen and by definition that's how

print works notice that hello it is

short but it's implemented ultimately

using the print function which does not

return a value as i'm using it here it

instead has this side effect of printing

something onto the screen so it is not

correct in my test function to check if

the return value of hello

equals equals hello david because again

hello is not returning anything it's

printing something that side effect but

notice literally it has no return

keyword unlike my square function which

did

so here's an opportunity to to perhaps

change how i go about

implementing my actual functions it

turns out that as your programs get more

and more sophisticated more and more

complicated it tends to be best practice

not to have side effects if you can

avoid it especially if you want your

code to be testable and in fact i'm

going to propose that we change my hello

program to now work as follows let me go

ahead and change this function to not

print hello and then that name let me go

ahead and literally return maybe an f

string which will clean this up a little

bit hello comma 2

close quote at the end so my syntax here

is just the familiar f string or format

string it's going to return hello world

or hello david or hello whoever's name

is passed in is that argument but i'm

returning it now i'm not printing it out

so what needs to change up here well i

could do something like this i could say

something like output equals hello and

then print output in my main function or

i can simplify that because i don't

really need that variable i could

instead just do this i could still call

hello but i could immediately print out

the result and this version of my hello

program now is actually more testable

why because these assert statements that

we're using and we've seen this far for

our tests are really designed to test

arguments into functions and return

values they're from not testing side

effects so if you're doing equals equals

you're looking for a return value

something that's handed back from the

function so that's fine if i modify the

design of my program now not to just

print hello but to return the string the

sentence the phrase that i want to

construct i can leave it to the caller

that is the function who's using this

hello function to handle the actual

printing now what does this mean in my

code well it means now if my hello.pi

looks like this and hello is indeed

returning a value in my test to low

function

i can test it exactly like this so let

me go ahead now and run pi test of test

hello dot pi crossing my fingers and it

passed because passing in david does

apparently return hello comma david well

let's do one other test two let's call

hello without any arguments and i think

that the return value there should be

hello world by default because the

default value of its parameter was meant

to be world so let me test this too oh

and

i cheated here let me rewind here

um

apologies

i think we'll fix this later

let me now go back to my test hello.pi

file and actually run it now and we'll

see that the one test we're running is

to assert that the return value of hello

david equals equals quote unquote hello

david so let me go ahead and run pi test

of test hello.pi crossing my fingers as

always and voila one passed so i passed

this test because apparently the return

value of hello does indeed equal hello

comma david well let's test the other

scenario what if i pat call hello

without any arguments let's assert that

calling hello with nothing in those

parentheses similarly equals hello comma

but world the default value let me now

go ahead and run pi test of test hello

dot pi and that too passes entirely but

there too suppose that i had made some

mistakes suppose that there were a bug

in my code it might not be best practice

to combine multiple tests in this one

function so let's make it more clear

what might pass or fail let's call the

first function test the default

to this function and let's only include

this first line of code and then let's

go ahead and define another function

like test argument to test this other

line of code here so now i have two

different tests each of which is testing

something a little fundamentally

different so now when i run my code it's

still not broken if i run pi test of

test hello.pi enter i've now passed two

tests and that's just as good as before

but if i did have a bug having two tests

instead of one would indeed give me

perhaps a bit more of a hint as to

what's wrong

questions now

on this testing of return values when

these return values are now strings

instead of integers and why we've done

this

yeah alon if i'm saying it right or alan

yes alan uh so my question is about

function inside the function

can we test that too

or recursion we

we haven't see

if you have if you have a recursive

function which we've not discussed in

this class yes you can absolutely test

those too

by simply calling them exactly in this

way recursion does not affect this

process other questions on testing in

this way

yeah over to uh justice

oh

wrenching middle screen is frozen on me

sorry one second there we go justice

still muted though

if you don't mind asking via the chat

i'm afraid i can't hear you here but

we'll do our best to answer in the chat

rohit over to you

rohit hello you're on the internet

hello hello

hello

my question was can we test input

yes can you test input you can and i've

not done this here but it turns out it's

a little more involved to test user

input and the syntax for doing so is a

little bit more intricate so for today's

purposes we'll focus only on testing

individual functions and leave for

another time the testing of input itself

all right how about one more question

here on unit test before we look at one

final example

uh gulken i'm sorry if i'm not saying

that right

yeah that's right thank you

um

when testing our uh

arguments like uh can we use something

like a loops or

inside of assets or for the values

absolutely you can absolutely use a loop

to test multiple values in this case for

instance i could do something like this

i could say for name in the following

list of hermione

say harry

and ron

i could then within this loop assert

that hello of that given name equals

equals

say

the format string of hello comma name

and then run all of these here at once

by running again pi test of testolo.pi

it's still going to be just one test

within that function but if there's

something interesting about those

several strings that makes it compelling

to test all of them you can absolutely

automate the tests in that way with that

said each of your tests should ideally

be pretty simple and pretty small why

because you don't want to write so much

code so much complicated code that your

tests might be flawed what we don't want

to have to do is write tests for our

tests and test for our test for our test

because it would never end so keeping

tests nice and simple is really the goal

so that a reasonable human yourself

included can eyeball them and just claim

yeah that is correct we don't need tests

for our tests

allow me to propose that we do one final

thing here particularly if we end up

having lots of tests instead of just one

we might want to start organizing these

tests into a folder and it turns out

that we can do this here as well let me

propose that i create a new folder this

time using make dir mkdir and create a

folder called test then i'm going to

within that folder

uh sorry let me think for a moment we

haven't introduced these commands but we

will in the online version of the class

rest assured give me just a moment

moment to think

um

okay

god

all right and how about one final

feature suppose that we have not just

one test in one file but we have a whole

bunch of tests such that we want to

organize all of those tests in a folder

that too is standard practice and pi

test supports that as well so for

instance suppose that i want to continue

testing this program hello.pi even

though it itself doesn't have many

functions i could go about creating a

folder called test as by

typing damn it

one sec

okay

try that once more apologies

let's introduce one other feature as

well suppose that you want to test this

program with multiple tests with someone

sorry

all right how about one other feature

suppose that we don't have just one test

but many different tests instead and we

want to start to organize those tests

into multiple files and even a folder

well pi test and other frameworks

support that paradigm as well in fact

let me go ahead and test hello.pi using

a folder of tests with technically just

one test but it'll be representative of

having even more in that folder i'm

going to go ahead and create a new

folder called test using makeder at my

command line and then within that file

i'm within that and then within that

folder i'm going to go ahead and create

a file called test hello dot pi

within this file meanwhile i'm going to

test the same things i'm going to go

ahead and from hello import hello

and i'm going to go ahead and define a

function like test default that simply

tests the scenario where hello with no

arguments returns hello comma world and

i'm going to have that other function

where i test that an argument is passed

and in this case i'll choose an argument

like asserting that hello quote unquote

david equals indeed hello comma not

world but david so in this case i've

just recreated the same test as earlier

but they're in a file now in a folder

called test well pi test allows me to

run these here too but to do so i

actually need to create one other file

within my test directory i need to

create a file called underscore

underscore init underscore underscore

dot pi which has the effect even if this

file is empty of telling python to treat

that folder as not just a module but a

package so to speak a package is a

python module or multiple modules that

are organized inside of a folder and

this file underscore underscore init

underscore underscore pi is just a

visual indicator to python that indeed

it should treat that folder as a package

if i had more code in this folder i

could do even more things with this file

but for now it's just a clue that it's

indeed meant to be a package and not

just a module or file alone what i can

now do in closing is run pi test not

even on that specific file but on a

whole folder of tests so if i run pi

test of test where the test is the name

of that folder pi test will

automatically search through that folder

looking for all possible tests granted

there's just those two in this one file

but when i run it now with enter i'll

still pass those tests i'll still get a

hundred percent and i now have a

mechanism ultimately for testing my own

code so whether you're writing functions

that return integers or something else

functions that have side effects that

could be rewritten as functions that

return values you now have a mechanism

to not just wait for want someone like

us to test your code and not just test

your code manually again and again which

might get tedious and you might make

mistakes by not including some possible

inputs we now have an automated

mechanism for testing one's own code

that's going to be even more powerful

when you start collaborating with others

so that you can write tests that ensure

that if they make a change to the same

code they haven't broken the code that

you've written

all that and more in the days to come

we'll see you next time

okay just we're going to take a 10

minute break now and we'll transition to

file i o so we'll see you in 10 or so

minutes

okay

all right we are back casually first any

questions about anything we just did or

what's about to happen before we dive in

the next lecture will be on file io and

when that one ends we'll be will be done

any questions here from the group uh

yeah your go

hi can you hear me yes hi

hi thanks for thanks for teaching us

thank you so much um

i just wanted to

make sure i understand understood um

underscore underscore init underscore

underscore pi does that what does that

tell python that it that the file of the

folder is

it tells python that it's a package

which means that it's a library

and it essentially makes it easier for

python to load other files so for

instance

very concretely

[Music]

notice that if i open up my

test directory

which contained this file

so in my test directory we ended up with

this file that it just imported from

hello import hello

what's that

oh yes thank you

um so what i've just done here um yorgo

is opened up testhello.pi

in my test folder and notice that it's

importing from hello import hello but

recall that my hello. file is not in the

test folder it's one level up so among

the things the package technique does is

it just makes it possible for python to

find the hello file it's it's stuff like

that this is sort of annoying python

convention that just works uh but

without it being um as obvious as it

could be

oh still muted

oh back to yoga

sorry yoga we lost you on the screen

coming back yes

still there we go

oh thank you sorry um so otherwise

um would python not find the the file to

test yeah i think so

let me try this let me remove the init

pot file

all right so let me i've just removed

init.pi

and now i'm going to run pi test on that

folder again and hit enter and you get

all of these module errors so so i

deliberately did it the right way so as

to not trip over this error

thank you so much sure how about time

for one or two other questions before we

forge ahead

yeah rohit

hello yep

hello

my question is how can we know where we

create our directory

say that once more

how can we know where we create our

directory

how did you how did i know where to

create the test directory

yes yes so that's just a convention like

when you start writing bigger projects

that have many tests it's just

convenient to organize them in a folder

called test it doesn't have to be called

test you could call it anything you want

but there's certain conventions and a

lot of programming languages and that

would be one you could call it test you

could call it tests plural

the point though is it just kind of

keeps your folder clean so you don't

have a hundred files all in one place

you can organize them a little more

cleanly

how about one other question before we

dive into file i o uh lavanya if i'm

saying it right

yes my question is

it's general in python generally in

print in double quote if you

write backslash and we'll get we'll be

going to the new line but if you want to

print this blackbox lesson how will we

do it

sure yeah unrelated to the previous talk

if we rewind recall that we talked about

new line characters as backslash n if

you want a literal backslash you do

backslash backslash n so you escape the

escape character and that's a common

paradigm if one doesn't do it try two

but that's not always the case but a

good question all right give me just a

moment to get set up here we're about to

dive into file i o and as always please

forgive if we can't get to everyone's

questions but my colleague carter if you

don't mind chiming in in the chat uh is

available if you want to ask questions

within the chat we'll do our best

between him and me to answer them either

on screen or off

yep give me just a moment

all right this is cs50s introduction to

programming with python my name is david

maylin and this is our week on file io

input and output of files so up until

now most every program we've written

just stores all the information that it

collects in memory that is in variables

or inside of the program itself a

downside of which is that as soon as the

program exits anything you typed in

anything that you did with that program

is lost now with files of course on your

mac or pc you can hang on to information

long term and file io within the context

of programming is all about writing code

that can read from that is load

information from or write to that is

save information to

files themselves so let's see if we

can't transition then from only using

memory and variables and the like to

actually writing code that saves some

files for us and therefore data

persistently well to do this let me

propose that we first consider a

familiar data structure a familiar type

of variable that we've seen before that

of a list and using lists we've been

able to store more than one piece of

information in the past using one

variable we typically store one value

but if that variable is a list we can

store multiple values unfortunately

lists are stored in the computer's

memory and so once your program exits

even the contents of those disappear but

let's at least give ourselves a starting

point so i'm over here in vs code and

i'm going to go ahead and create a

simple program using code of names.pi a

program that just collects people's

names students names if you will and i'm

going to do it super simply initially in

a manner consistent with what we've done

in the past to get user input and print

it back out i'm going to say something

like this

name equals input quote unquote what's

your name thereby storing in a variable

called name the return value of input as

always

and as always i'm going to go ahead and

very simply print out a nice f string

that says hello comma and then in curly

braces name to print out hello david

hello world however happens to be using

the program let me go ahead and run this

just to remind myself what i should

expect and if i run python of names.pi

and hit enter type in my name like david

of course i now see hello comma david

suppose though that we wanted to add

support not just for one name but

multiple names maybe three names for the

sake of discussion so that we can begin

to accumulate some amount of information

in the program such that it's really

going to be a downside if we keep

throwing it away once the program exits

well let me go back into names.pi up

here at top let me proactively give

myself a variable this time called names

plural and set it equal to an empty list

recall that the square bracket notation

especially if nothing's inside of it

just means give me an empty list that we

can add things to over time well what do

we want to add to it well let's add

three names each from the user and let

me say something like this

for underscore in range of three

let me go ahead and prompt the user with

the input function and getting their

name in this variable and then using

list syntax i can say names dot append

name to that list

and now i have in that list that given

name one two three of them other points

to note is i could use a variable here

like i which is conventional but if i'm

not actually using i explicitly on any

subsequent lines i might as well just

use underscore which is a pythonic

convention and actually if i want to

clean this up a little bit right now

notice that my name variable doesn't

really need to exist because i'm

assigning it a value and then

immediately appending it well i could

tighten this up further by just getting

rid of that variable altogether

and just appending immediately the

return value of input i think we could

go both ways in terms of design here on

the one hand it's a pretty short line

and it's readable on the other hand if i

were to eventually change this phrase to

be not what's your name but something

longer we might want to break it out

again into two lines but for now i think

it's pretty readable now later in the

program let's just go ahead and print

out those same names but let's sort them

alphabetically so that it makes sense to

be gathering them all together

then sorting them and printing them so

how can i do that well in python the

simplest way to sort a list in a loop is

probably to do something like this for

name in

names but wait let's sort the names

first recall that there's a function

called sorted which will return a sorted

version of that list now let's go ahead

and print out an f-string that says

again hello bracket name

close quotes all right let me go ahead

and run this so python of names.pi and

let me go ahead and type in a few names

this time how about hermione

how about harry

how about ron and notice that they're

not quite in alphabetical order but when

i hit enter and that loop kicks in it's

going to print out hello harry hello

hermione hello ron in sorted order but

of course now if i run this program

again all of the names are lost and if

this is a bigger program than this that

might actually be pretty painful to have

to re-input the same information again

and again and again wouldn't it be nice

like most any program today on a phone

or a laptop or desktop or cloud to be

able to save this information somehow

instead and that's where file i o comes

in and that's where files come in they

are a way of storing information

persistently on your own phone or mac or

pc or some cloud servers

disk so that they're there when you come

back and run the program again so how

can we go about saving all three of

these names on in a file as opposed to

having to type them again and again well

let me go ahead and rewind and simplify

just so we can do one thing at a time

and i'm going to go ahead and do this

i'm still going to prompt the user for a

name and i'm going to go ahead and ask

them what's your name as before storing

the return value in a variable but now

i'm going to do something a little

different suppose i want to store this

name and all future names in a file

called names.txt

for text file how can i do that well in

python i could do this i can give myself

a variable called file for instance i

could call it anything i want equals

open of quote-unquote

names.text

and then quote-unquote w so what is this

doing well it turns out in python there

is a function called

sorry

well it turns out in python there's a

function called open that does literally

just that you give it the name of a file

to open and a second argument optionally

as to how to open it and it will open

the file for you in a way that you can

then read from it to get information or

write to it to save information now this

function here is documented at this url

here in python's official documentation

as always and ultimately it's going to

allow us to do a little something like

this if i go back to vs code here and i

don't want to do that

all right sorry let me just rewind just

so we can get this right

apologies

all right

let me go ahead and simplify this file

and again give myself just a single

variable called name and set the return

value of input equal to that variable so

what's your name as before quote-unquote

and now let me go ahead and let me do

something more with this value instead

of just adding it to a list or printing

it immediately out let's save the value

of the person's name that's just been

typed in to a file

well how do we go about doing that well

in python there's this function called

open whose purpose in life is to do just

that to open a file but to open it up

programmatically so that you the

programmer can actually read information

from it or write information to it so

open is like the programmer's equivalent

of like double clicking on an icon on

your mac or pc but it's a programmer's

technique because it's going to allow

you to specify exactly what you want to

read from or right to that file

formally its documentation is here and

you'll see that its usage is relatively

straightforward it minimally just

requires the name of the file that we

want to open and optionally how we want

to open it so let me go back to vs code

here and let me propose now that i do

this i'm going to go ahead and call this

function called open passing in an

argument for names.txt which is the name

of the file i would like to store all of

these names in i could call it anything

i want but because it's going to be just

text it's conventional to call it

something dot txt but i'm also going to

tell the open function that i plan to

write to this file so as a second

argument to open i'm going to put

literally quote unquote w for write and

that's going to tell open to open the

file in a way that's going to allow me

to change the contents and better yet if

it doesn't even exist yet it's going to

create the file for me now open returns

what's called a file handle a special

value that allows me to access that file

subsequently so i'm going to go ahead

and assign it equal to a variable like

file and now i'm going to go ahead and

quite simply write this person's name to

that file so i'm going to literally type

file which is the variable

linking to that file dot write which is

a function otherwise known as a method

that comes with open files that allows

me to write that name to the file and

then lastly

i'm going to quite simply going to go

ahead and say file.close which will

close and effectively save the file so

these three lines of code here are

essentially the programmers equivalent

to like double clicking an icon on your

mac or pc making some changes in

microsoft word or some other program and

going to file save we're doing that all

in code with just these three lines here

well let's see now how this works let me

go ahead now and run python of names.pi

and enter let's type in a name i'll type

in hermione

enter all right where did she end up

well let me go ahead now and type code

of names.txt

which is a file that happens now to

exist because i opened it in right mode

and if i open this in a tab we'll see

there is hermione well let's go ahead

and run names.pi once more i'm going to

go ahead and run python of names.pi

enter and this time i'll type in harry

let me go ahead and run it one more time

and this time i'll type in ron and now

let me go up to names.txt where

hopefully i'll see all three of them

here

but no i've just actually seen ron

what might explain what happened to

hermione and harry even though i'm

pretty sure i ran the program three

times and i definitely wrote the code

that writes their name to that file

what's going on here do you think vishal

oh still mirror

um

i think because we are not appending

them we should append the names uh since

we are writing directly it is erasing

the old content and it is replacing with

the last

uh

set of characters that we mentioned

exactly unfortunately quote unquote w is

a little dangerous not only will it

create the file for you it will also

recreate the file for you every time you

open the file in that mode so if you

open the file once and write hermione

that worked just fine as we saw but if

you do it again for harry if you do it

again for ron the code is working but

each time it's opening the file and

recreating it with brand new contents so

we had one version with hermione one

version with harry and one final version

with ron but ideally i think we probably

want to be appending as vishal says each

of those names to the file not just

clobbering that is overwriting the file

each time so how can i do this it's

actually a relatively easy fix let me go

ahead and do this as follows i'm going

to first remove the old version of

names.txt and now i'm going to change my

code to do this i'm going to change the

w quote-unquote to just a quote-unquote

a for append which means to add to the

bottom to the bottom to the bottom again

and again now let me go ahead and rerun

python of names.pi enter i'll again

start from scratch with hermione because

i'm creating the file new

notice that if i now do code of

names.txt enter

we do see that hermione is back so we've

after removing the file it did get

recreated even though i'm using append

which is good but now let's see what

happens when i go back to my terminal

and this time i run python of names.pi

again this time typing in harry and let

me run it one more time this time typing

in ron so hopefully this time in that

second tab names.txt i should now see

all three of them but

but but but

this doesn't look ideal

what have i clearly done wrong

something tells me even though all three

names are there it's not going to be

easy to read those back unless you know

where each name ends and begins hope

hope

the english form it's not correct

the english format is not correct like

it's a

it's contaminating them

it is it's it's

well it appears to be concatenating but

technically speaking it's just appending

to the file first hermione then harry

then ron it has the effect of combining

them back to back but it's not

concatenating per se it really is just

appending let's go to another hand here

what really have i done wrong

or equivalently how might i fix

it would be nice if there were some kind

of gaps between each of the names so we

could read them more cleanly

how about we call on

uh elena over to you

hello uh we should add a new line before

we

write new name

good we want to add a new line ourselves

so whereas print by default recall

always outputs automatically a line

ending of backslash n unless we override

it with the named parameter called end

write does not do that right takes you

literally and if you say right hermione

that's it you're getting the h through

the e if you say right harry you get the

h through the uh y you don't get any

extra new lines automatically so if you

want to have a new line at the end of

each of these names we've got to do that

manually so let me again close names.txt

and let me remove the current file and

let me go back up to my code here and i

can fix this in any number of ways but

i'm just going to go ahead and do this

i'm going to write out an f string that

contains name and backslash n at the end

we could do this in different ways we

could manually print just the new line

or some other technique but i'm going to

go ahead and use my f strings as i'm in

the habit of doing and just print to the

name and the new line all at once i'm

going to go ahead now and down to my

terminal window run python of names.pi

again enter we'll type in hermione i'm

going to run it again type in harry i'm

going to type it again and this time ron

now i'm going to run code of names.txt

and open that file and now it looks like

the file is a bit cleaner indeed i have

each of the name on its own line as well

as align ending which ensures that we

can separate one from the other now if i

were you know writing code i bet i could

parse that is read the previous file by

looking at differences between lowercase

and uppercase letters but that's going

to get messy quickly generally speaking

when storing data long term in a file

you should probably do it somehow

cleanly like doing one name at a time

well let's now go back and i'll propose

that this code is now working correctly

but we can design it a little bit better

it turns out that it's all too easy when

writing code to sometimes forget to

close files and sometimes this isn't

necessarily a big deal but sometimes it

can create problems files could get

corrupted or accidentally deleted or the

like depending on what happens in your

code so it turns out that you don't

strictly need to call close on the file

yourself if you take another approach

instead more pythonic when

manipulating files is to do this to

introduce this other keyword called

quite simply with that allows you to

specify that in this context i want you

to open and automatically close some

file so how do we use with it simply

looks like this let me go back to my

code here i've gotten rid of the closed

line and i'm now just going to say this

instead instead of saying file equals

open i'm going to say with open then the

same arguments as before and somewhat

curiously i'm going to put the variable

at the end of the line why that's just

the way this is done you say with you

call the function in question and then

you say as and specify the name of the

variable that should be assigned the

return value of open then i'm going to

go ahead and indent the line underneath

so that the line of code that's writing

the name is now in the context of this

with statement which just ensures that

automatically if i had more code in this

file down below no longer indented the

file would be automatically closed as

soon as line four is done executing so

it doesn't change what has just happened

but it does automate the process of at

least closing things for us just to

ensure i don't forget and so that

something

doesn't go wrong

but suppose now that i wanted to read

these names from the file all i've done

thus far is write code that writes names

to the file but let's assume now that we

have all of these names in the file and

heck let's go ahead and add one more let

me go ahead and run this one more time

python of names.pie and let's add in

draco to the mix so now that we have all

four of these names here how might we

want to read them back well let me

propose that we go into names.pi now or

we could create another program

altogether but i'm going to keep reusing

the same name just to keep us focused on

this and now i'm going to write code

that reads an existing file with

hermione harry ron and draco together

and how do i do this well it's similar

in spirit i'm going to start this time

with with

open and then the first argument is

going to be the name of the file that i

want to open as before and i'm going to

open it this time in read mode quote

unquote r and to read a file just means

to load it not to save it

and i'm going to name the return value

file and now i'm going to do this and

there's a number of ways i can do this

but one way to read all of the lines

from the file at once would be this let

me declare a variable called lines let

me access that file and call a function

or a method that comes with it called

read lines so if you read the

documentation on file i o in python

you'll see that open files come with a

special method whose purpose in life is

to read all the lines from the file and

return them to me as a list so what this

line two is doing is it's reading all of

the lines from that file storing them in

a variable called lines now suppose i

want to iterate over all of those lines

and print out each of those names for

line in lines this is just a standard

for loop in python lines is a list line

is the variable that will be

automatically sippy set to each of those

lines let me go ahead and print out

something like oh hello

comma and then i'll print out the line

itself

all right so let me go to my terminal

window run python of names.pi now i have

not deleted names.txt so it still

contains all four of those names and hit

enter

and okay it's not bad but it's a little

ugly here

what's going on when i ran names.pie

it's saying hello to hermione to harry

to ron to draco but there's these gaps

now between the lines

what's explains that symptom if if

nothing else it just looks ugly uh

overfall if i'm saying it right

[Music]

yeah that's right uh

it happens because in the text file we

have a new line symbols

in between those names and the print

always adds another new line at the end

so you

use the same symbol twice perfect and

here's a good example of a bug a mistake

in a program but if you just think about

those first principles like how do each

of the lines of code work that i'm using

you should be able to reason exactly as

raphael did there to say that all right

well one of those new lines is coming

from the file after each name and then

of course print all of these weeks later

is still giving us for free that extra

new line so there's a couple possible

solutions i could certainly do this

which we've done in the past and pass in

a named argument to print like end

equals quote unquote and that's fine i

would argue a little better than that

might actually be to do this to strip

off of the end of the line the actual

new line itself so that print is

handling the printing of everything the

person's name as well as the new line

but you're just stripping off what is

really just an implementation detail in

the file we chose to use new lines in my

text file to separate one name from

another so arguably it should be a

little cleaner in terms of design to

strip that off and then let print print

out what is really just now a name but

that's ultimately a design decision the

effect is going to be exactly the same

well if i'm going to open this file and

read all the lines and then iterate over

all of those lines and print them each

out i could actually combine this into

one thing because right now i'm doing

twice as much work i'm reading all of

the lines then i'm iterating over all of

the lines just to print out each of them

well in python with files you can

actually do this i'm going to erase

almost all of these lines now keeping

only the with statement at top and

inside of this with statement i'm going

to say this

for line in file

go ahead and print out quote unquote

hello comma and then line.rstrip so i'm

going to take the approach of stripping

off the end of the line but notice how

elegant this is so to speak i've opened

the file in line one and if i want to

iterate over every line in the file i

don't have to very explicitly load all

read all the lines then iterate over all

of the lines i can combine this into one

thought in python you can simply say for

line in file and that's going to have

the effect of giving you a for loop that

iterates over every line in the file one

at a time and on each iteration updating

the value of this variable line to be

hermione then harry then ron then draco

so this again is one of the appealing

aspects of python is that it reads

rather like english for line and file

print this it's a little more compact

when written this way

well what if though

i don't want quite this behavior because

notice now if i run python of names.pi

it's correct i'm seeing each of the

names in each of the hellos and there's

no extra spaces in between

but just to be

difficult i'd really like us to be

sorting these hellos really i'd like to

see draco first then harry then hermione

then ron no matter what order they

appear in the file so i could go in of

course to the file and manually change

the file but if that file is changing

over time based on who is typing their

name into the program that's not really

a good solution in code i should be able

to load the file no matter what it looks

like and just sort it all at once

now here is a reason to not do what i've

just done i can't iterate over each line

in the file and print it out but sort

everything in advance right logically if

i'm looking at each line one at a time

and printing it out it's too late to

sort i really need to read all of the

lines first without printing them sort

them then print them so we have to take

a step back in order to add now this new

feature so how can i do this well let me

combine some ideas from before let me go

ahead and start fresh with this let me

give myself a list called names and

assign it an empty list just so i have a

variable in which to accumulate all of

these lines and now let me open the file

with open

quote-unquote names.txt and it turns out

i can tighten this up a little bit it

turns out if you're opening a file to

read it you don't need to specify quote

unquote r that is the implicit default

so you can tighten things up by just

saying open names.txt and you'll be able

to read the file but not write it i'm

going to give myself a variable called

file as before i am going to iterate

over the file in the same way for line

in file but instead of printing each

line

i'm going to do this i'm going to take

my names list and append to it and this

is appending to a list in memory not

appending to the file itself i'm going

to go ahead and append the current line

but i'm going to strip off the new line

at the end so that all i'm adding to

this list is each of the students names

now i can use that familiar technique

from before let me go outside of this

with statement because now i've read the

entire file presumably so by the time

i'm done with lines four and five again

and again and again for each line in the

file i'm done with the file it can close

i now have all of the students names in

this list variable let me do this for

name in not just names but the sorted

names using our python function sorted

which does just that and do print quote

unquote with an fstring hello comma

and now i'll plug in bracket name

so now what have i done

i'm creating a list at the beginning

just so i have a place to gather my data

i then on lines three through five

iterate over the file from top to bottom

reading in each line one at a time

stripping off the new line and adding

just the student's name to this list and

the reason i'm doing that is so that on

line seven i can sort all of those names

now that they're all in memory and print

them in order i need to load them all

into memory before i can sort them

otherwise i'd be printing them out

prematurely and draco would end up last

instead of first so let me go ahead in

my terminal window and run python of

names.pi now and hit enter and there we

go the same list of four hellos but now

they're sorted and this is a very common

technique when dealing with files and

information more generally if you want

to change that data in some way like

sorting it

creating some kind of variable at the

top of your program like a list adding

or appending information to it just to

collect it in one place and then do

something interesting with that

collection that list is exactly what

i've done here let me pause and see if

there's any questions now on file i o

reading or writing or now accumulating

all of these values in some list

yeah nathan question

hi is there a way to sort the files but

instead if you want it from

alphabetically from a to z

is there a way to reverse it from z to a

is there like a little extension you can

add to the end to do that or would you

have to create a new function

if you wanted to reverse the contents of

the file

did i hear you right

yeah so if you instead of sorting them

from a to z in ascending order if you

wanted them in descending order

is there an extension for that

there is indeed and as always the

documentation is your friend so if the

goal is to sort them not in alphabetical

order which is the default but maybe

reverse alphabetical order you can take

a look for instance at the formal python

documentation there and what you'll see

is this summary you'll see that the

sorted function takes a first argument

generally known as an iterable and

something that's iterable means that you

can iterate over it that is you can loop

over it one thing at a time what the

rest of this line here means is that you

can specify a key like how you want to

sort it but more on that later but this

last named parameter here is reverse and

by default per the documentation it's

false it will not be reversed by default

but if we change that to true i bet we

can do that so let me go back to vs code

here and do just that let me go ahead

and pass in a second argument to sorted

in addition to this iterable which is my

names list iterable again in the sense

that it can be looped over and let me

pass in reverse equals true thereby

overriding the default of false let me

now run python of names.pi and now ron's

at the top and draco's at the bottom so

there too whenever you have a question

like that moving forward consider what

does the documentation say and see if

there's a germ of an idea there because

odds are if you have some problem odds

are some programmer before you have had

the same question other thoughts

on these uh maria

can we limit a number or numbers of

names

and the second question uh can we find

specific name in list

really good question can we limit the

number of the names in the file and can

we find a specific one we absolutely

could

if we were to write code we could for

instance open the file first count how

many lines are already there and then if

there's too many already we could just

exit with sys.exit or some other message

to indicate to the user that sorry the

class is full as for finding someone

specifically absolutely you could

imagine opening the file iterating over

it with a for loop again and again and

then adding a conditional like if the

current line equals equals harry then we

found the chosen run and you can print

something like that so you can

absolutely combine these ideas with

previous ideas like conditionals to ask

those same questions

how about one other question on

file i o

yeah how about over to philip

oh yeah hello

uh so i just thought about

this function like

uh read all lines

and

it looks like it's

uh

like separate all the lines by this

special character a backslash n but it

looks like we don't needed a character

and we

we always strip it

and

it looks like some bad design of

function why

why wouldn't we just strip it inside

this function a really good question so

we are in my examples thus far using r

strip to reverse uh to strip from the

end of the line all of this white space

you might not want to do that in this

case i am stripping it away because i

know that each of those lines isn't some

generic line of text each line really

represents a name that i have put there

myself i'm using the new line just to

separate one value from another in other

scenarios you might very well want to

keep that line ending because it's a

very long series of text or a paragraph

or something like that where you want to

keep it distinct from the others but

it's just a convention we have to use

something presumably to separate one

chunk of text from another there are

other functions in python that will in

fact handle the removal of that white

space for you

read lines though does literally that

though it reads all of the lines as is

well allow me to turn our attention back

to where we left off here which is just

names to propose that with names.txt we

have an ability it seems to store each

of these names pretty straightforwardly

but what if we wanted to keep track of

other information as well suppose that

we wanted to store information

including a student's

name and their house at hogwarts be it

gryffindor or slytherin or something

else well where do we go about putting

that you know hermione lives in

gryffindor so we could do something like

this in our text file harry lives in

gryffindor so we could do that ron lives

in gryffindor so we could do that and

draco lives in slytherin so we could do

that but i worry here

but i worry now that we're mixing apples

and oranges so to speak like some lines

or names some lines or houses so this

probably isn't the best design if only

because it's confusing or it's ambiguous

so maybe what we could do is adopt a

convention and indeed this is in fact

what a lot of programmers do they change

this file not to be names.txt but

instead let me create a new file called

names.csv

csv stands for comma separated values

and it's a very common convention to

store multiple pieces of information

that are related in the same file and so

to do this i'm going to separate each of

these types of data not with another new

line but simply with a comma i'm going

to keep each student on their own line

but i'm going to separate the

information about each student using a

comma instead and so now we sort of have

a two-dimensional file if you will row

by row we have our students but if you

think of these commas as representing a

column even though it's not perfectly

straight because of the lengths of these

names it's a little rat it's a little

jagged you can think of these commas as

representing a column and it turns out

these csv files are very commonly used

when you use something like microsoft

excel apple numbers or google

spreadsheets and you want to export the

data to share with someone else as a csv

file or conversely if you want to import

a csv file into your preferred

spreadsheet software like excel or

numbers or google spreadsheets you can

do that as well so csv is a very common

very simple text format that just

separates values with commas and

different types of values ultimately

with new lines as well

so suppose now that i have this file

called names.csv

and actually i'm going to make a quick

change for our video here apologies

um

apologies

i'm going to rename this file just for

the sake of discussion and andrew let me

ramone let me give you guys the audio

let me go ahead and run

sorry

let me go ahead and run code of

students.csv

and paste all of those same names in but

dot dot okay that gives us the footage

for that

all right

all right give me one moment apologies

i'm going to do that once more just so

we get the logic here correct so i don't

break things for us later

let me go ahead and create a new let me

go ahead and create a new file called

students.csv

pasting in those same names dot dot

oh sure apologies uh i just need to do

something for our video team here then

we'll get back on track

okay

giving them some silence deliberately

let me go ahead and run code of

students.csv to create a brand new file

that's initially empty and we'll add to

it those same names but also some other

information as well

okay

all right and ramona we can fix it later

if need be i think

okay

so if i now have this new file

students.csv inside of which is one

column of names so to speak and one

column of houses how do i go about

changing my code to read not just those

names but also those names and houses so

that they're not all on one line we

somehow have access to both type of

value separately well let me go ahead

and create a new program here called

students.pi

and in this program let's go about

reading not a text file per se but a

specific type of text file a csv a comma

separated values file and to do this i'm

going to use similar code as before i'm

going to say with

open quote-unquote students.csv

i'm not going to bother specifying

quote-unquote r because again that's the

default but i'm going to give myself a

variable name of file and then in this

file i'm going to go ahead and do this

for line in file as before

and now i have to be a bit clever here

let me go back to students.csv

looking at this file

and it seems that on my loop on each

iteration i'm going to get access to the

whole line of text i'm not going to

automatically get access to just

hermione or just gryffindor

recall that the loop is going to give me

each full line of text so logically what

would you propose that we do inside of a

for loop that's reading a whole line of

text at once but we now want to get

access to the individual values like

hermione and gryffindor harry and

gryffindor how do we go about taking one

line of text and gaining access to those

individual values do you think just

instinctively even if you're not sure

what the name of the functions would be

yeah dev your thoughts

still muted

you can access access it as you would

and if you were using the dictionary

like using a key and value

so ideally we would access it using a

key in value but at this point in the

story all we have is this loop and this

loop is giving me one line of text that

is the time i'm the programmer now i

have to solve this there is no

dictionary yet in question how about

another suggestion here

what can i do once i have this loop here

uh

anjali did i get it right this time

okay

anjali um so you can somehow split the

two words based on the comma

yeah even if you're not quite sure what

function is going to do this intuitively

you want to take this whole line of text

hermione comma gryffindor harry comma

gryffindor and so forth and split that

line into two pieces if you will and it

turns out wonderfully the function we'll

use is actually called split that can

split on any characters but you can tell

it what character to use so i'm going to

go back into students.pie and inside of

this loop i'm going to go ahead and do

this i'm going to take the current line

i'm going to remove the white space at

the end as always using r strip here and

then whatever the result of that is i'm

going to now call split

and quote unquote comma so the split

function or method comes with strings

stirs in python any stir has this method

built in and if you pass in an argument

like a comma what this strip split

function will do is split that current

string into one two three maybe more

pieces by looking for that character

again and again ultimately strip uh

ultimately split is going to return to

us a list of all of the individual parts

to the left and to the right of those

commas so i can give myself a variable

called row here and this is a common

paradigm when you know you're iterating

over a file specifically a csv it's

common to think of each

line of it as being a row and each of

the values they're in separated by

commas as columns so to speak so i'm

going to deliberately name my variable

rho just to be consistent with that

convention and now what do i want to

print well i'm going to go ahead and say

this

print how about the following

an f string that starts with

curly braces

well how do i get access to the first

thing in that row well the row is going

to have how many parts two because if

i'm splitting on commas and there's one

comma per line that's going to give me a

left part and a right part like hermione

and gryffindor harry and gryffindor

when i have a list like row how do i get

access to individual values well i can

do this i can say row

bracket 0 and that's going to go to the

first element of the list which should

hopefully be the student's name

then after that i'm going to say is in

and i'm going to have another curly

brace here for row bracket 1 and then

i'm going to close my whole quote so it

looks a little cryptic at first glance

but most of this is just f string syntax

with curly braces to plug in values and

what values am i plugging in well row

again is a list and it has two elements

presumably hermione in one and

gryffindor and the other and so forth so

bracket zero is the first element

because remember we start indexing at

zero in python and one is going to be

the second element so let me go ahead

and run this now and see what happens

python

of

students.pie

enter

and we see hermione is in gryffindor

harry's and gryffindor ron is in

gryffindor and draco is in slytherin so

we have now implemented our own code

from scratch that actually parses that

is reads and interprets a csv file

ultimately here

now let me pause to see if there's any

questions but we'll make this even

easier to read in just a moment

any questions on what we've just done

here by splitting by comma

yeah uh

sharia if i'm saying it right

oh

no question

okay someone else

vishal question

uh thanks uh for uh

so my question is uh can we uh edit uh

any line of code anytime we want or uh

the only option that we have is to

append uh

the lines or uh let's say if we want to

let's say change harry's uh house to

let's say slytherin or some other house

yeah a really good question what if you

want to in python change a line in the

file and not just

append to the end you would have to

implement that logic yourself so for

instance you could imagine now

opening the file and reading all of the

contents in

then maybe iterating over each of those

lines and as soon as you see that the

current name equals equals harry you

could maybe change his house to

slytherin and then it would be up to you

though to write all of those changes

back to the file so in that case you

might want to in simplest form read the

file once and let it close

then open it again but open for writing

and change the whole file it's not

really possible or easy to go in and

change just part of the file though you

can do it it's easier to actually read

the whole file make your changes in

memory then write the whole file out but

for larger files where that might be

quite slow you can be more clever than

that

well let me propose now that we clean

this up a little bit because i actually

think this is a little cryptic to read

row bracket zero row bracket one it's

it's not that well written at the moment

i would say but it turns out that when

you have a variable that's a list like

row you don't have to throw all of those

variables into a list you can actually

unpack that whole sequence at once that

is to say if you know that a function

like split returns a list but you know

in advance that it's going to return two

values in a list the first and the

second you don't have to throw them all

into a variable that itself is a list

you can actually unpack them

simultaneously into two variables doing

name comma house so this is a nice

python technique to not only create but

assign

automatically

in parallel two variables at once rather

than just one so this will have the

effect of putting the name in the left

hermione and it will have the effect of

putting gryffindor the house in the

right variable and we now no longer have

a row we can now make our code a little

more readable by now literally just

saying name down here and for instance

house down here so just a little more

readable even though functionally the

code now is exactly the same

all right so this now works and i'll

confirm as much by just running it once

more python of students.pi enter and we

see that the text is as intended but

suppose for the sake of discussion that

i'd like to sort

this list of output i'd like to say

hello again to draco first then hello to

harry than hermione then ron how can i

go about doing this well let's take some

inspiration from the previous example

where we're only dealing with names and

instead do it with these full phrases so

and so is in house well let me go ahead

and do this i'm going to go ahead and

start scratch and give myself a list

called students equal to an empty list

initially and then with open

students.csv

as file i'm going to go ahead and say

this for line in file and then below

this i'm going to do exactly as before

name comma house equals the current line

stripping off the white space at the end

splitting it on a comma so that's exact

same as before but this time before i go

about

printing the sentence i'm going to store

it temporarily in a list so that i can

accumulate all of these sentences and

then sort them later so let me go ahead

and do this students which is my list

dot append

let me append the actual sentence i want

to show on the screen so another f

string so name is in house just as

before but notice i'm not printing that

sentence i'm appending it to my list not

a file but to my list why am i doing

this well just because as before i want

to do this for student in the sorted

students i want to go ahead and print

out students like this well let me go

ahead and run python of students.pi and

hit enter now and i think we'll see

indeed draco is now first harry is

second hermione's third and ron is

fourth

but this is arguably a little sloppy

right it seems a little hackish that i'm

constructing these sentences and even

though i'm technically want to sort by

name i'm technically sorting by these

whole english sentences so it's not

wrong it's achieving the intended result

but it's not really well designed

because i'm just kind of getting lucky

that english is reading from left to

right and therefore when i print this

out it's sorting properly it would be

better really to come up with a

technique for sorting by the students

names not by some english sentence that

i've constructed here on line six

so to achieve this

i'm going to need to make my life more

complicated for a moment and i'm going

to need to collect information about

each student

before i bother assembling that sentence

so let me propose that we do this let me

go ahead and undo these last few lines

of code so that we currently have two

variables name and house each of which

has name in the student's house

respectively and we still have our

global variable students but let me do

this recall that python supports

dictionaries and dictionaries are just

collections of keys and values so you

can associate something with something

else like a name with hermione like a

house with gryffindor that really is a

dictionary so let me do this let me

temporarily create a dictionary that

stores this association of name with

house let me go ahead and do this let me

say that the student here is going to be

represented initially by an empty

dictionary and just like you can create

an empty list with square brackets you

can create an empty dictionary with

curly braces so give me an empty

dictionary that will soon have two keys

name and house how do i do that well i

could do it this way student open

bracket name

equals the student's name that we got

from the line student bracket house

equals the house that we got from the

line and now i'm going to append to the

students list plural

that particular student now why have i

done this i've admittedly made my code

more complicated it's more lines of code

but i've now collected all of the

information i have about students while

still keeping track what's a name what's

a house the list meanwhile has all of

the students names and houses together

now why have i done this well let me for

the moment just do something simple let

me do four students in students and let

me very simply now say print the

following f string the current student

with this name

is in

this current student's house

and now notice one detail inside of this

f string i'm using my curly braces as

always

i'm using inside of those curly braces

the name of a variable as always

but then i'm using not bracket 0 or 1

because these are dictionaries now not

list but why am i using single quotes

to surround house and to surround name

why single quotes inside of this

f-string

to access those

keys yeah armando

yes um because you have double quotes

in that in that line 12 and so you have

to tell python to differentiate

exactly because i'm already using double

quotes outside of the f string if i want

to put quotes around any strings on the

inside which i do need to do for

dictionaries because recall when you

index into a dictionary you don't use

numbers like lists 0 1 2 onward you

instead use strings which need to be

quoted but if you're already using

double quotes it's easiest to then use

single quotes on the inside so python

doesn't get confused about what lines up

with what so at the moment when i run

this program it's going to print out

those hellos but they're not yet sorted

in fact what i now have is a list of

dictionaries and nothing is yet sorted

but let me tighten up the code too to

point out that it doesn't need to be

quite as verbose if you're in the habit

of creating an empty dictionary like

this on line six and then immediately

putting in two keys name and house each

with two values name and house

respectively you can actually do this

all at once so let me show you a

slightly different syntax i can do this

give me a variable called student and

let me use curly braces on the right

hand side here but instead of leaving

them empty let's just define those keys

and those values now quote unquote name

will be name and quote-unquote house

will be house this achieves the exact

same effect in one line instead of three

it creates a new non-empty dictionary

containing a name key the value of which

is the student's name and a house key

the value of which is the student's

house nothing else needs to change that

will still just work

so that if i again run python of

students.pie i'm still seeing those

greetings but they're still not quite

actually sorted well what might i go

about doing here in order to what could

i do to improve upon this further

well we need some mechanism now of

sorting those students but unfortunately

you can't do this we can't sort all of

the students now because those students

are not names like they were before they

aren't sentences like they were before

each of the students is a dictionary and

it's non-obvious how you would sort a

dictionary inside of a list

so ideally what do we want to do we are

currently aspiring to print sentences

whoops

so what do we want to do

okay let me undo that

so what do we

all right so what do we actually want to

do if at the moment we hate hit line

nine we have a list of all of these

students and inside of that list is one

dictionary per student and each of those

dictionaries has two keys name and house

wouldn't it be nice if there were a way

in code to tell python sort this list by

looking at this key in each dictionary

because that would give us the ability

to sort either by name or even by house

or even by any other field that we add

to that file so it turns out we can do

this we can tell the sorted function not

just to reverse things or not it takes

another positional

it takes another named parameter called

key where you can specify what key

should be used in order to sort some

list of dictionaries and i'm going to

propose that we do this i'm going to

first define a function temporarily for

now called get name and this function's

purpose in life given a student is to

quite simply return the student's name

from that particular dictionary so if

student is a dictionary this is going to

return literally the student's name and

that's it that's the sole purpose of

this function in life

what do i now want to do well now that i

have a function that given a student

will return to me the student's name i

can do this i can change sorted to say

use a key that's equal to whatever the

return value of get name is and this now

is a feature of python

python allows you to pass functions as

arguments

in two other functions so getname is a

function sorted is a function and i'm

passing in get name to sorted as the

value of

that key parameter

now why am i doing that well if you

think of the getname function as just a

bunch a block of code that will get the

name of a student that's handy because

that's the capability that sorted needs

when given a list of students each of

which is a dictionary

sorted needs to know how do i get the

name of the student in order to do

alphabetical sorting for you the authors

of python didn't know that we were going

to be creating students here in this

class so they couldn't have anticipated

writing code in advance that

specifically sorts on a field called

student let alone called name let alone

house

so what did they do they instead built

into the sorted function this named

parameter key that allows us all these

years later to tell their function

sorted how to sort this list of

dictionaries so now watch what happens

if i run python of students.pi and hit

enter i now have a sorted list of output

why because now that list of

dictionaries has all been sorted by the

student's name

i can further do this if as before we

want to reverse the whole thing by

saying reverse equals true we can do

that too let me rerun python of

students.pi and hit enter now it's

reversed now it's ron then hermione

harry and draco but we can do something

different as well what if i want to sort

for instance by house name reversed i

could do this i could change this

function from get name to get house i

could change the implementation up here

to be git house and i can return not the

student's name but the student's house

and so now notice if i run python of

students.pi enter notice now it is

sorted by house in reverse order

slytherin is first and then gryffindor

if i get rid of the reverse but keep the

get house and rerun this program now

it's sorted by house gryffindor is first

and slytherin is last and the upside now

of this is because i'm using this list

of dictionaries and keeping the students

data together until the last minute when

i'm finally doing the printing i now

have full control over the information

itself and i can sort by this or that i

don't have to construct construct those

sentences in advance like i rather

hackishly did the first time

all right that was a lot let me pause

here to see if there are questions

yeah uh let's see uh got kim from saying

it's right

still muted

there we go

yeah hello uh

so when when we sorting the files should

we every time we use the

loops or

like uh like a dictionary or or any kind

of list can we sort by just sorting not

looping or

any kind of stuff

a good question and the short answer

with python alone you're the programmer

you need to do the sorting with

libraries and other techniques

absolutely you can do more of this

automatically because someone else has

written that code what we're doing at

the moment is doing everything from

scratch ourselves but absolutely with

other functions or libraries some of

this could be made uh more uh easily

done

some of this could be made easier other

questions

on this technique here

uh yeah let's see

abdelaram if i'm saying it right

yeah hey how are you

okay

inserted sorted function yeah in what

and what uh in what way is the search

function arranged graphender

in pause of trigger venture

let's see i was having a little

trouble hearing you can you say it once

more

okay in what

in what way

a sorted search function arranged it

griffinder in

this regular venture

in what way is sorted arranging things

so sorted will return to a list of items

that are assorted according to whatever

the key is by default if you just pass

sorted a list of strings which we did

earlier it's just going to sort the

strings alphabetically if though you

pass sorted a list of dictionaries and a

dictionary again is a collection of keys

and values

there's no default understanding of what

it means to sort things that are

dictionaries you need to tell the sorted

function what key in each dictionary

should be compared against all the other

keys so i'm currently doing this by

house and i could also do it as before

by student because the authors of python

didn't know that our dictionaries all

these years later would have names and

houses or other keys as well other

questions now on this technique

ibrahim if i'm saying it right

oh yes you hear me yes we can

no i just missed the part uh what uh

this uh student civ includes

student civ file includes students.csv

only includes these two columns name on

the left and house on the right

thank you thank you i didn't see it how

about time for one more question on

this csv approach

uh yeah push

nope okay

one more

oh

push we actually can't hear you even

though you're unmuted maybe you're

headphones weren't working

muhammad over to you

i have two questions if you sure

the first one

the key can it equal to uh just a

variable not outcome of a github

function this is my first question

i'm not sure i caught that did you

i

the key the key yeah the key

yes uh

it's equal to the returned value of the

function

uh can it be

equal to

just a

variable or a

value

it well yes it should equal a value so i

am specif and i should clarify actually

since this was not obvious

so when you pass in a function like get

name or get house to the sorted function

as the value of key that function is

automatically called by the get

by the sorted function for you on each

of the dictionaries in the list and it

uses the return value of get name or get

house to decide what strings to actually

use to compare in order to decide which

is alphabetically correct so this

function which you pass just by name you

do not pass in parentheses at the end

is called by the sorted function in

order to figure out for you how to

compare these same values

oh sure go ahead

uh

how can we use the nested dictionaries

i have

read about nested dictionaries what is

the difference between nested

dictionaries and the dictionary inside a

list yeah i think it is sure um

uh so we are using a list of

dictionaries why because each of those

dictionaries represents a student and a

student has a name and a house and we

want to i claim maintain that

association and it's a list of students

because we've got multiple students four

in this case you could create us a

structure that is a dictionary of

dictionaries but i would argue it just

doesn't solve a problem i don't need a

dictionary of dictionary i need a list

of key value pairs right now that's all

so let me propose if we go back to

students.pi here and we revert back to

the approach where we have get name as

the function both used and defined here

and that function returns the student's

name what happens to be clear is that

the sorted function will use the value

of key get name in this case

calling that function on every

dictionary in the list that it's

supposed to sort

and that function getname returns the

string that sorted will actually use to

decide whether things go in this order

left right or in this order right left

it alphabetizes things based on that

return value so notice that i'm not

calling the function get name here with

parentheses i'm passing it in only by

its name so that the sorted function can

call that get name function for me now

it turns out as always if you're

defining something be it a variable or

in this case a function

and then immediately using it

but never once again needing the name of

that function like get name we can

actually tighten this code up further i

can actually do this i can get rid of

the get name function altogether just

like i could get rid of a variable that

isn't strictly necessary and instead of

passing key the name of a function i can

actually pass key what's called in a

lambda function which is an anonymous

function a function that just has no

name why because you don't need to give

it a name if you're only going to call

it in one place and the syntax for this

in python is a little weird but if i do

key equals literally the word lambda

then something like student which is the

name of the parameter i expect this

function to take and then i don't even

type the return key i instead just say

student bracket name so what am i doing

here with my code

this code here that i've highlighted is

equivalent to the get name function i

implemented a moment ago the syntax is

admittedly a little different i don't

use def i didn't even give it a name

like get name i instead i'm using this

other keyword in python called lambda

which says hey python here comes a

function but it has no name it's

anonymous that function takes a

parameter i could call it anything i

want i'm calling it student why because

this function that's passed in as key is

called on every one of the students in

that list every one of the dictionaries

in that list what do i want this

anonymous function to return well given

a student i want to index into that

dictionary and access their name so that

the string hermione and harry and ron

and draco is ultimately returned and

that's what the sorted function uses to

decide how to sort these bigger

dictionaries that have other keys like

house as well

so if i now go back to my terminal

window and run python of students.pi it

still seems to work the same but

it's arguably a little better design

because i didn't waste lines of code by

defining some other function calling it

in one and only one place i've done it

all sort of in one breath if you will

all right let me pause here to see if

there's any questions specifically about

lambda or anonymous functions and this

tightening up of the code

uh yeah uh suyan if i'm saying it right

uh professor it is swam

and i have a question like whether we

could define lambda twice can you you

can use lambda twice you can create as

many anonymous functions as you'd like

and you generally use them in context

like this where you want to pass to some

other function uh a function that itself

does not need a name so you can

absolutely use it in more than one place

i just have only one use case for it

right now other questions on lambda and

these anonymous functions rohit

hello

yes hello

my question is not from lambda but

i have a doubt can we sort characters

from a word

can you sort by what

characters from a word

can you sort the characters in a word

yes you can but let me save that problem

for another day you could absolutely do

something like that but we need to do

more work than we're doing here at the

moment we're operating on strings how

about one other question on lambda or

anonymous function specifically philip

oh yeah

uh uh what what if our lambda

would take more than one line for

example

if and imagine this sure if your lambda

function takes multiple parameters that

is fine you can simply specify

commas followed by the names of those

parameters maybe x and y or so forth

after the name student so here too

lambda looks a little different from def

in that you don't have parentheses you

don't have the keyword def you don't

have a function name but ultimately they

achieve that same effect they create a

function anonymously and allow you to

pass it in for instance as some value

here

well let me propose that we're cut we're

in a good place now even though this is

a lot to digest all at once because

we've gone from just reading files to

now writing them and then reading them

with multiple fields separated by commas

unfortunately our code is still a little

fragile it seems to work fine for these

inputs but suppose that we were to

change our csv file not to store

students home how not to store students

houses but their homes like where those

students from hogwarts actually grew up

so let me propose that we actually do

this suppose that we jot down that um

say

uh draco

lives in slytherin now but grew up in

malfoy manor uh

let's fix this

sorry just one moment

okay

let's make a change so let's now change

students.csv to contain not students

houses at hogwarts but their homes where

they grew up so draco for instance grew

up in malfoy manor

ron grew up in the borough

harry grew up in

number four

privet drive

and according to the internet no one

knows where hermione grew up the movies

apparently took certain liberties with

where she grew up so for this purpose

we're actually going to remove hermione

because it is unknown exactly where she

was born so we still have some three

students but if anyone can spot the

potential problem now

how might this be a bad thing well let's

go and try and run our own code here let

me go back to students.pie here and let

me propose that i just changed my

semantics because i'm now not thinking

about hogwarts houses but the students

own home so i'm just going to change

some variables i'm going to change this

house to a home

this house to a home as well as this one

here i'm still going to sort the

students by name but i'm going to say

that they're not in a house but rather

from a home so i've just changed the

names of my variables and my grammar in

english here ultimately to print out

that for instance harry is from number

four privet drive and so forth but let's

see what happens here when i run python

of this version of students.pi having

changed students.csv to contain those

homes and not houses enter

huh our first value error like the

program just doesn't work

what might explain this value error the

explanation of which rather cryptically

is too many values to unpack and the

line in question is this one involving

split

how did all of a sudden after all of

these successful runs of this program

did line five suddenly now break asanda

um in the line in students that says

you have three values there's a line

that you have three values and

instruments yeah i spent a lot of time

trying to figure out where uh every

student should be from so that we could

create this problem for us and

wonderfully like the first sentence of

the book is number four privet drive and

so the fact that that address has a

comma in it is problematic why because

you and i decided some time ago to just

standardize on commas csv comma

separated values to denote the uh

we standardized on commas in order to

delineate one value from another and if

we have commas grammatically in the

student's home we're clearly confusing

it as this special symbol and the split

function is now for just harry trying to

split it into three values not just two

and that's why there's too many values

to unpack because we're only trying to

assign two variables name and house now

what could we do here well we could just

change our approach for instance like

one paradigm that is not uncommon is to

use something a little more

a little less common like a vertical bar

so i could go in and change all of my

commas to vertical bars that too could

eventually come back to bite us in that

if my file eventually has vertical bar

somewhere it might still break so maybe

that's not the best approach i could

maybe do something like this i could

escape the data as i've done in the past

and maybe i could put quotes around any

english string that itself contains a

comma and that's fine i could do that

but then my code students.pie is going

to have to change too because i can't

just naively split on a comma now i'm

going to have to be smarter about it i'm

going to have to take into account split

only on the commas that are not inside

of quotes and oh it's getting

complicated fast and at this point you

need to take a step back and consider

you know what if we're having this

problem odds are many other people

before us have had this same problem it

is incredibly common to store data in

files it is incredibly common to use csv

files specifically and so you know what

why don't we see if there's a library in

python that exists to read and or write

csv files rather than reinvent a wheel

so to speak let's see if we can write

better code by standing on the shoulders

of others who have come before us

programmers passed and actually use

their code to do the reading and writing

of csvs so we can focus on the part of

our problem that you and i care about so

let's propose that we go back to our

code here and see how we might use the

csv library indeed within python there

is a module called csv the documentation

for it is at this url here in python's

official documentation but there's a few

functions that are pretty readily

accessible if we just dive right in and

let me propose that we do this let me go

back to my code here and instead of

reinventing this wheel and reading the

file line by line and splitting on

commas and dealing now with quotes and

privet drives and so forth let's do this

instead at the start of my program

let me go up and import the csv module

let's use this library that someone else

has written that's dealing with all of

these corner cases if you will i'm still

going to give myself a list initially

empty in which to store all these

students but i'm going to change my

approach here now just a little bit when

i open this file with with

let me go in here and change this a

little bit i'm going to go in here now

and say this

reader equals csv dot reader passing in

file as input so it turns out if you

read the documentation for the csv

module it comes with a function called

reader whose purpose in life is to read

a csv file for you and figure out where

are the commas where are the quotes

where are all the potential corner cases

and just deal with them for you you can

override certain defaults or assumptions

in case you're using not a comma but a

pipe or something else but by default i

think it's just going to work now how do

i iterate over a reader and not the raw

file itself it's almost the same the

library allows you still to do this for

each row in the reader so you're not

iterating over the file directly now

you're iterating over the reader which

is again going to handle all of the

parsing of commas and new lines and more

for each row in the reader what am i

going to do

well at the moment i'm going to do this

i'm going to append to my students list

the following dictionary a dictionary

that has a name whose value is the

current rows first column and whose

house or rather home now is the rows

second column

so here it's worth noting that reader

isn't quite as fancy as my dictionary

based approach a moment ago

whereby

sorry

ah

now it's worth noting that the reader

isn't quite as foreign reader oh can i

do that

sorry let me test one thing real fast uh

name

um

i will explain in just a moment just to

want to misspeak and disappoint

perfect okay

now it's worth noting that the reader

for each line in the file indeed returns

to me a row but it returns to me a row

that's a list which is to say that the

first element of that list is going to

be the student's name as before the

second element of that list is going to

be the students home

as now before but if i want to access

each of those elements remember that

lists are zero indexed we start counting

at zero and then one rather than one and

then two so if i want to get at the

student's name i use row bracket 0 and

if i want to get at the student's home i

use row bracket 1. but in my for loop we

can do that same unpacking as before if

i know this csv is only going to have

two columns i could even do this for

name

home in reader and now i don't need to

use list notation i can unpack things

all at once and say name here and home

here

the rest of my code can stay exactly the

same because what am i doing now on line

eight i'm still constructing the same

dictionary as before albeit for homes

instead of houses and i'm grabbing those

values now not from the file itself and

my use of split but the reader and again

what the reader is going to do is figure

out where are those commas where are the

quotes and just solve that problem for

you so let me go now down to my terminal

window and run python of students.pi and

hit enter and now we see successfully

sorted no less that draco is from

malform manor harry is from number four

comma privet drive and ron is from the

borough

questions now on this technique of using

csv

reader from that csv module

which again is just getting us out of

the business of reading each line

ourselves and reading each of those

commas and splitting piyush

hi there

um so my questions are related to

something

in the past

i recognize that you are reading a file

every time you well you we're

we're assuming that we have the csv file

to hand already in this case

um is it possible to make

a file

readable and writeable so in in case if

you want you could uh you could write

some stuff to the file

but then at the same time you could have

another function that

reads through the phone that's changes

to it as you go along a really good

question and the short answer is yes

however historically the mental model

for a file is that of a cassette tape

years ago not really in use anymore but

cassette tapes are sequential whereby

they start at the beginning and if you

want to get to the end you kind of have

to

unwind the tape to get to that point the

closest analog nowadays would be

something like netflix or any streaming

service where there's a scrubber that

you have to go left to right you can't

just jump there or jump there you don't

have random access so the problem with

files if you want to read and write them

you or some library needs to keep track

of where you are in the file so that if

you're reading from the top and then you

write at the bottom and you want to

start reading again you seek back to the

beginning so it's not something we'll do

here in class it's more involved but

it's absolutely doable

for our purposes we'll generally

recommend read the file and then if you

want to change it write it back out

rather than trying to make more

piecemeal changes which is good if

though the file is massive and it would

just be very expensive time wise to

change the whole thing

other questions on this

csv reader

uh yeah

over to uh

dokaba if i'm saying it right

yeah exactly

um

is possible to write

a paragraph in that file

absolutely right now i'm writing very

small strings just names or houses as i

did before but you can absolutely write

as much text as you want

indeed

other questions on csv reader

uh yeah maria

yes uh can a user choose

himself a key like input key will be a

name or home

now the program will

be so short answer

yes we could absolutely write a program

that prompts the user for a name and a

home a name and a home and we could

write out those values and in a moment

we'll see how you can write to a csv

file for now i'm assuming as the

programmer who created students.csv that

i know what the columns are going to be

and therefore i'm naming my variables

accordingly however this is a good segue

to one final feature of reading csvs

which is that you don't have to rely on

either getting a row as a list and using

bracket zero or bracket one and you

don't have to unpack things manually in

this way we could actually be smarter

and start storing the names of these

columns in the csv file itself and in

fact if any of you have ever opened a

spreadsheet file before be it in excel

apple numbers google spreadsheets or the

like odds are you've noticed that the

first row very frequently is a little

different it actually is bold phase

sometimes or it actually contains the

names of those columns the names of

those attributes below and we can do

this here in students.csv i don't have

to just keep assuming that the student's

name is first and that the student's

home is second i can explicitly bake

that information into the file just to

reduce the probability of mistakes down

the road i can literally use the first

row of this file and say name comma home

so notice that

name is not literally someone's name and

home is not literally someone's home it

is literally the words name and home

separated by a comma and if i now go

back into students.pie and don't use csv

reader but instead i use a dictionary

reader i can actually

treat my csv file even more flexibly not

just for this but for other examples too

let me do this instead of using a csv

reader let me use a csv dict reader

which will now

iterate over the file top to bottom

loading in each line of text not as a

list of columns but as a dictionary of

columns what's nice about this is that

it's going to give me automatic access

now to those columns names i'm going to

revert to just saying for row in reader

and now i'm going to append a name and a

home but how am i going to get access to

the current rows

name and the current rows home well

earlier i used bracket 0 for the first

and bracket 1 for the second when i was

using a reader a reader returns lists a

dict reader or dictionary reader returns

dictionaries one at a time and so if i

want to access the current row's name i

can say row quote-unquote name i can say

here for home row quote-unquote home and

i now have access to those same values

the only change i had to make to be

clear was in my csv file i had to

include on the very first row little

hints as to what these columns are and

if i now run this code i think it should

behave pretty much the same python of

students.pi and indeed we get the same

sentences but now

my code is more robust against changes

in this data if i were to open this csv

file in excel or google spreadsheets or

apple numbers and for whatever reason

change the columns around maybe this is

a file that you're sharing with someone

else and just because they decide to

sort things differently left to right by

moving the columns around

previously my code would have broken

because i was assuming that name is

always first and home is always second

but if i did this be it manually in one

of those programs or here home comma

name and suppose i reversed all of this

the home comes first followed by harry

the borough then by ron

and then lastly malfoy manor then draco

notice that my file is now completely

flipped the first column's now the

second and the seconds the first but i

took care to update the header of that

file the first row notice my python code

i'm not going to touch it at all i'm

going to rerun python of students.pi and

hit enter and it still just works and

this too is an example of like coding

defensively like what if someone changes

your csv file your data file ideally

that won't happen but even if it does

now because i'm using a dictionary

reader that's going to infer from that

first row for me what the columns are

called my code just keeps working and so

it keeps getting if you will better and

better

any questions now

on this approach

or anything else with csvs

uh yeah nelly

what is important of new line in cs3

file

uh what about the new line in the csv

file

yeah what is the importance of newline

csv file what's the importance of the

new line in the csv file it's partly a

convention in the world of text files we

humans have just been for decades in the

habit of storing

data line by line it's visually

convenient it's just easy to extract

from the file because you just look for

the new lines so the new line just

separates some data from some other data

we could use any other symbol on the

keyboard but it's just common to hit

enter to just move the data to the next

line just a convention

other questions from

kb

um thank you sure um

so

it seems to be working fine

if you just have name at home i'm

wondering what will happen

if you want to

put in more data

um

say

you wanted to add the house to both the

name and the home

sure if you wanted to add the house back

so if i go in here and at house last and

i go here and say gryffindor for harry

gryffindor for ron and slytherin for

draco now i have three columns

effectively if you will home on the left

name in the middle house on the right

each separated by commas with weird

things like number four comma privet

drive still quoted notice if i go back

to students.pi and i don't change the

code at all

and run python of students.pi it still

just works and this is what's so

powerful about a dictionary reader it

can change over time it can have more

and more columns your existing code is

not going to break your code would break

would be much more fragile so to speak

if you were making assumptions like the

first column's always going to be name

the second column is always going to be

house things will break fast if those

assumptions break down

so not a problem in this case

well let me propose that besides reading

csvs let's at least take a peek at how

we might write a csv too if you're

writing a program in which you want to

store not just students names but maybe

their homes as well in a file how can we

keep adding to this file well let me go

ahead and propose that we do this let me

go ahead and remove students.csv

so that it no longer exists and we'll

recreate it now programmatically

in code i'm going to go ahead and open

up students.pie and in students.pai

let's go ahead and still import csv at

the top let's go ahead now and prompt

the user for two things a name of a

student and the home of the same so name

equals input quote unquote what's your

name question mark and then this one

home equals input quote unquote where's

your home so now the file doesn't yet

exist we're going to create it

programmatically in code

with open quote unquote students.csv but

but but this time i'm going to open it

in append mode i erase the file so it

doesn't yet exist append will

automatically create it if need be but

it's not going to change it again and

again it's going to keep appending to it

it won't overwrite so once i have this

file open as a variable called file

let's do this i need a different feature

of the csv module called a dictionary

writer so i'm going to do this

writer equals csv.dictwriter

and this is just a feature of the

library that gives you the ability to

write to a csv file and i'm going to

pass in as input two things not just one

i'm going to pass in the file itself so

that it knows where to write the csv val

these comma separated values too and i'm

going to pass in a named parameter

called field names and you only know

about this from the documentation alone

or this example here the field names i

want to write to this file are going to

be respectively name

and home i'm going to go with just two

left to right what do i want to do now

that i've created that dictionary writer

well let me call a function that comes

with the writer a method called write

row and it takes as input a dictionary

and that's why this is a dictwriter and

not just a

writer alone that takes lists a

dictionary writer takes a dictionary for

each row a collection of key value pairs

that you want this library to put in the

right columns so what do i want to write

i'm going to write a dictionary using my

curly braces as always whose name is

whatever the student's name is in that

variable from earlier and whose home is

whatever the value of that home variable

is from earlier

so again i'm not going to bother

printing out any commas i'm not going to

print out any new lines i'm going to let

the dict writer function handle all of

that for me so that's it i don't even

need to close the file because once

you're at the end of a width it will

just close automatically so let me go

ahead and run python of students.pie and

hit enter

all right what's your name let's go

ahead and start with harry enter where's

your home

number 4 comma privet drive which could

potentially break things but i think the

library will be smart enter

and nothing bad seems to happen which is

generally a good thing let's open

students.csv and see what the new

version looks like

it looks like as hoped that module

the csv module handled the comma and

handled the quoting for me let's try one

other student let's go back to

students.pi let's go ahead and run

python of students dot pi what's your

name ron the borough enter

okay no errors that's good let's go back

to students.csv and there's ron and the

borough let's try one more and i'll

leave the csv open python

of students.pie enter what's your name

draco and lives in uh malfoy manor enter

and watch the csv file at the top of the

screen

there it is he appears at the top

so that's how we might edit this file

using a dictionary writer which allows

us to automate this process of creating

that file not needing to do it from

scratch

any questions now

on writing

or

reading csvs

uh harris over to you

uh hello david and this is harris from

new zealand i only have one question and

is there any specifics specific

situation for me to use single quotation

or double quotation because

after the print we use single quotation

to represent the key of the dictionary

but after the

reading or writing we use the double

quotation

it's a good question in python you can

generally use double quotes or you can

use single quotes and it doesn't matter

you should just be self-consistent so

that stylistically your code looks the

same all throughout

sometimes though it is necessary to

alternate if you're already using double

quotes as i was earlier for a long f

string but inside that f string i was

interpolating the values of some

variables using curly braces and those

variables were dictionaries and in order

to index into a dictionary you use

square brackets and then quotes but if

you're already using double quotes out

here you should generally use single

quotes here or vice versa but otherwise

i'm in the habit of using double quotes

everywhere others are in the habit of

using single quotes everywhere it only

matters sometimes if one might be

confused for the other

other questions on dictionary uh writing

or reading uh metalli if i'm saying it

right

uh yeah daily my question is can we use

multiple csv files in any program

absolutely you can use as many csv files

as you want and it's just one of the

formats that you can use to save data

other questions on csvs or file io

yeah michael

yeah um

thanks for

taking my question uh so when you're

reading from the file the um

you had the um

as a dictionary you had the fields

called

um couldn't you just call when you're

reading could couldn't you just call the

row

couldn't you just call them

uh

so

in the previous version of the of the

students

uh pie file

um

when you're reading the uh

when you're reading each row you are

splitting out the um

the fields by name

can you

yeah so when you're appending to the uh

to the student's list can you just call

the for row and reader students not

append row rather than

uh

rather than naming each of the fields oh

very clever uh short answer yes insofar

as dict reader returns one dictionary at

a time

when you loop over it row is already

going to be a dictionary so yes you

could actually get away with doing this

and the effect would really be the same

in this case good observation how about

one more question on csvs

yeah joaquim

um

yeah when reading in csvs from my past

work with data a lot of things can go

wrong i don't know if it's a fair

question that you can answer in a few

sentences but are there any best

practices

to double check that sort of no mistakes

occurred it's a really good question and

i would say in general if you're using

code to generate the csvs and to read

the csvs and you're using a good library

theoretically nothing should go wrong it

should be 100 correct if the libraries

are 100 correct uh you and i tend to be

the problem like when you let a human

touch the csv or when excel or apple

numbers or some other tools involved

that might not be aligned with your

code's expectations things then yes can

break

the goal really sometimes honestly the

solution is manual fixes you go in and

fix the csv or you have a lot of error

checking or you have a lot of try except

just to tolerate mistakes in the data

but generally i would say if you're

using csv or any file format internally

to a program to both read and write it

you shouldn't have concerns there you

and i the humans are the problem

generally speaking and not the

programmers the users of those files

instead we'll allow me to propose that

we pivot ultimately

from csvs to one other type of file

indeed actually let me fix this so this

is not on the screen

i may reset sorry

all right allow me to propose that we

leave csvs behind but to note that

they're not the only file format you can

use in order to read or write data in

fact they're a popular format as is just

raw text files.txt files but you can

store data really any way that you want

we've just picked csvs because it's

representative of how you might read and

write from a file and do so in a

structured way where you can somehow

have multiple keys multiple values all

in the same file without having to

resort to what would be otherwise known

as a binary file so a binary file is a

file that's really just zeros and ones

and they can be laid out in any pattern

you might want particularly if you want

to store not textual information but

maybe graphical or audio or video

information as well so it turns out that

python is really good when it comes to

having libraries for really everything

and in fact there's a popular library

called pillow that allows you to

navigate image files as well and to

perform operations on image files you

can apply filters a lot instagram you

can

animate them as well and so what i

thought we'd do is leave behind text

files for now and tackle one more

demonstration this time focusing on

this particular library and image files

instead so let me propose that we go

over here to vs code and create a

program ultimately that creates an

animated gif these things are everywhere

nowadays in the form of memes and

animations and stickers and the like in

an animated gif is really just an image

file that has multiple images inside of

it and your computer or your phone shows

you those images one after another

sometimes on an endless loop again and

again and so long as there's enough

images it creates the illusion of

animation because your mind and mind

kind of fills in the gaps visually and

just assumes that if something is moving

even though you're only seeing one frame

per second or some sequence thereof it

looks like an animation so it's like a

simplistic version of a video file well

let me propose that we start with maybe

a couple of uh costumes from another

popular programming language and let me

go ahead and open up my first costume

here number one so suppose here that

this is a costume or really just a

static image here

costume1.jiff and it's just a static

picture of a cat no movement at all let

me go ahead now and open up a second one

costume2.jiff that looks a little bit

different notice and i'll go back and

forth this cat's legs are a little bit

aligned differently so that this was

version one

and this was version two now these cats

come from a programming language from

mit called scratch that allows you very

graphically to animate all this and more

but we'll use just these two static

images costume 1 and costume 2 to create

our own animated gif that after this you

could text to a friend or message them

much like any meme online well let me

propose that we create this animated gif

not by just using some off-the-shelf

program that we downloaded but by

writing our own code i'm going to go

ahead and create a new file here

with code called costumes.pi whose

purpose in life is going to be to oops

spoiler sorry

sorry

well you'll see how that's about what

we're about to do

let me go ahead and run code of

costumes.pie and create our very own

program that's going to take as input

two or even more image files and then

generate an animated gif from them by

essentially creating this animated gif

by toggling back and forth endlessly

between those two images well how am i

going to do this well let's assume that

this will be a program called

costumes.pi that expects

two command line arguments the names of

the files the individual costumes that

we want to animate back and forth so to

do that i'm going to import sys so that

we ultimately have access to sis.rgv

i'm then from this pillow library going

to import support for images

specifically so from pil import image

capital i as per the library's

documentation now i'm going to give

myself an empty list called images just

so i have a list in which to store one

or two or more of these images and now

let me do this

for each argument in

sys.org v

i'm going to go ahead and create a new

image variable set it equal to this

image

dot

open function passing in arg now what is

this doing i'm proposing that eventually

i want to be able to run python of

costumes.pi and then as command line

arguments specified costume1.gif space

costume2.gif so i want to take in those

file names from the command line as my

arguments so what am i doing here well

i'm iterating over sys.rgv all of the

words in my command line arguments i'm

creating a variable called image and i'm

passing to this function image.open from

the pillow library that specific

argument and that library is essentially

going to open that image in a way that

gives me a lot of functionality for

manipulating it like animating now i'm

going to go ahead and

append to my images list

that particular image and that's it so

this loop's purpose in life is just to

iterate over the command line arguments

and open those images using this library

the last line is pretty straightforward

i'm going to say this i'm going to grab

the first of those images which is going

to be in my list at location 0

and i'm going to save it to disk that is

i'm going to save this file now in the

past when we use csvs or text files i

had to do the file opening i had to do

the file writing maybe even the closing

i don't need to do that with this

library the pillow library takes care of

the opening the closing and the saving

for me by just calling save i'm going to

call this save function and just to

leave space because i have a number of

arguments to pass i'm going to move to

another line so it fits i'm going to

pass in the name of the file that i want

to create

costume.gif that will be the name of my

animated gif i'm going to tell this

library to save all of the frames

that i passed to it so the first costume

the second costume and even more if i

gave them i'm going to then append to

this first image the image is zero

the following images

equals this list of images and this is a

bit clever but i'm going to do this i

want to append the next image there

images one and now i want to specify a

duration of 200 milliseconds for each of

these frames and i want this to loop

forever and if you specify loop equals

zero that is time zero it means it's

just not going to loop a finite number

of times but an infinite number of times

instead and i need to do one other thing

recall that sys.rgv

contains not just the words i typed

after my program's name but what else

does sys.org v contain

if you think back to our discussion of

command line arguments

what else is in sis.rgv besides the

words i'm about to type like

costume1.gif and costume2

uh how about mackenzie your thoughts

yeah hi can you hear me yes we can

yeah so we'll actually get in that the

original name of the program we want to

run indeed a costume set pie indeed

we'll get the original name of the

program costumes.pie in this case which

is not a gif obviously so remember that

using slices in python we can do this if

sys.rgb is a list and we want to get a

slice of that list everything after the

first element we can do one colon which

says start it in location one not zero

and take a slice all the way to the end

so give me everything except the first

thing in that list which to mackenzie's

point is the name of the program now if

i haven't made any mistakes let's see

what happens i'm going to run python of

costumes.pie

i'm going to oops sorry

i'm going to run pythonofcostumes.pi

there we go

i'm going to run python of costumes.pi

and now i'm going to specify the two

images that i want to animate so

costume1.gif and costume2.jiff

what is the code now going to do well to

recap we're using the sys library to

access those command line arguments

we're using the pillow library to treat

those files as images and with all the

functionality that comes with that

library i'm using this images list just

to accumulate all of these images one at

a time from the command line and in

lines seven through nine i'm just using

a loop to iterate over all of them and

just add them to this list after opening

them with the library and the last step

which is really just one line of code

broken onto three so that it all fits

i'm gonna save the first image but i'm

asking the library to append this other

image to it as well not bracket zero but

bracket one and if i had more i could

express those as well i want to save all

of these files together i want to pause

200 milliseconds a fifth of a second in

between each frame and i want it to loop

infinitely many times so now if i cross

my fingers as always hit enter

nothing bad happened and that's almost

always a good thing let me now run

codeofcostumes.gif

to open up in vs code the final image

and what i think i should see is a very

happy cat and indeed so now we've seen

not only that we can read and write

files be it textually we can read and

now write files that are binary zeros

and ones we've just scratched the

surface this is using the library called

pillow but ultimately this is going to

give us the ability to read and write

files however we want so in order to use

this technique in your programs it'll

amount to using functions like open in

libraries and we can't wait to see what

you achieve with them next all right

that's it for this week we will see you

next time

all right can they are we live again

okay we are officially a wrap for today

but wanted to leave a couple minutes for

questions if folks have them before we

drop off here

thank you again for joining us it's such

a

such a fun

time to gather each week to actually do

this even though we're learning to

program but somehow uh

hopefully it's all fun questions from

the group here roderick over to you

hi uh

hi david uh so my question is uh in

python aren't we allowed

aren't we required

to actually uh explicitly uh write the

path of those

um

file let's say for example for the

custom that give

uh aren't we uh required to actually uh

write the path to access those

file

or python actually

reads it on its own by importing some of

those libraries uh it's not the latter

it's something in between what you

propose so when you don't specify the

path python and a lot of languages just

look in the current directory so

whatever folder your python file is in

the program will assume that your gifs

are in as well

so if co if these files were elsewhere

for instance in a subfolder i might have

needed to do something like this

folder slash costume.gif

folder slash costume2.gif you might have

to specify but i have very deliberately

put them all in my same folder just to

make my life easier for now

good question others from the group uh

yashfie

oh yeah first of all thank you for

today's lecture it was very much fun

and my question was that how can we

introduce

costume.gif in our uh code space

oh these files so if you go to if carter

you don't mind uh take a look at the

chat yes and we'll paste the url of

today's code and i included the gifs

costume one and two in the folder for

today so that you can create the same

other questions uh rajul if i'm saying

it right

yes uh so my question was related uh

generally to computer science okay so if

i want to go inside like in the field of

ai and ml and i have taken cs15 cs50

python this one so what should i take

next so if you really like ai a

colleague of ours teaches an ai course

with python if carter you wouldn't mind

pasting that one too um keep an eye on

the chat in a moment rajul and i might

suggest that one

next oh sorry

wrenching can we unmute yeah

yes i have another question uh it was

related to someone asked a question

yesterday like he asked that

python will be used to develop apps

and you said only java would be used not

too much of python so if the app uses

machine learning

so will python player on there or java

could do that stuff oh you can

absolutely do um machine learning stuff

with java but if you're thinking about

an app in like the mobile device sense

like an uh a tablet or a phone

a lot of the machine learning stuff is

probably done server side anyway so you

could write python code on a server that

the app talks to over the internet and

then you could use any python libraries

that might be popular that you might

want to use as well um when i said that

python generally speaking it's and for

android it's java and kotlin and for ios

it's swift and um objective-c that are

typically used for apps

okay thank you sure i think we have time

for one more question if that's okay

then we have to drop off here in

cambridge over to um

how about uh dogoba if you can hear me

yes yes for sure

so i would

like to

ask about

the gif

costume

could we

have

more

extra stickers

to try to animate

oh interesting um

we weren't planning on that if you

post in one if you email me after class

my email address should be on the

course's website we can point you at

some others what i did to grab those

costumes was i used scratch which has a

web page and i just exported the images

in order to get the frames to use them

for this and we can point out so i have

one question can we add a html and

python together to make something fun

like animation work

uh short answer yes um

you could do it for animation it's often

python used for web programming more

generally if carter you wouldn't mind

pasting the link of another class a

colleague of ours teaches one on python

and web stuff

you might like that as well

sure and i hope you'll forgive that we

need to drop off here in cambridge but

we'll be in touch via email but the next

class thank you all so much again for

spending time with us and for tolerating

all of my mistakes uh you'll see the new

and improved version online ultimately

but see you all online soon thank you

you
